<h2>Storyline Walkthrough</h2>
<p>This walkthrough is based on Old Good Stalker Evolution (OGSE) version 0693 with default setup (at installation), played at Master level. OGSE has some storyline revisions, but mostly keeps to the original while offering some additional optional tasks. In this walkthrough, I focus on those options and deviations from the original storyline. This is still a work in progress and if you know of any tasks I may have missed, please feel free to email me with instructions on how to acquire the task.</p>

<h2 id="bloodstone">Bring radioactive Blood Stone artifact</h2>

<p>Your first task is to fetch an artifact out of the center of the ravine that is northwest of Sid's bunker. As you leave the bunker, you are stopped by Seryoga Stalin. If you call him "sir" he preceives you as weak and charges you 300 RUs each time you want to enter the bunker again. Continue northwest, go into the drainage tile, and straight down into the ravine. Go up onto the fallen tree, turn left, and walk along the tree until you see the artifact between two large branches. Pick the artifact up and retrace your steps out. About this time you can hear a helicopter firing rockets and Sidorovich radios you to check on his contact, Tolik. After you help him out and loot the corpses, take the artifact to Sidorovich to complete the task.</p>

<div><b>NOTE:</b> If you ask Wolf about Tolik's condition, Wolf gives you a reward.</div>

<h2 id="atp">Peacefully free the captive at the ATP</h2>

<p>During <i>Get information from scout</i> task you have a third option for rescuing Nimble. Ask Petruha if there's another way besides the traditional attack or go it alone. The plan is for you to wear bandit gear to get in and bluff your way into releasing Nimble. When you get to the ATP, go upstairs and talk to the bandit sleeping on the floor. Take the bottom options of the conversation to complete the mission. However, the task to <i>Kill the bandits at the car park</i> remains on your PDA. If you stop to tell Petruha that the plan worked, he and his men go back to the Rookie Village.</p>

<h2 id="sid">Sidorovich Optional Missions</h2>

<p>After you have freed Nimble from the bandits, you can ask Sidorovich for the usual "I need a job." tasks. The first "Go any special missions for me?" task is <a href="#deal">The deal with the military</a>. OGSE offers a third option, "Sidorovich, do you have some personal errands?" that include <a href="#guitar">Find the guitar.</a>, <a href="#milanomaly">The military at the anomaly</a>, and <a href="#mercs">Mercenaries at the Cordon</a>.</p>

<h3 id="deal">The deal with the military</h3>

<p>This mission is a simple matter of taking a car to the bridge and back again. However, there's several steps you have to follow to complete the mission. First, you have to "Get a bag of artifacts from Wolf". Pretty straight forward - walk over and ask him for his box of artifacts. Take the box/bag to the front of the car, which is parked on the west side of the red brick house southwest of Wolf. The default control for opening the trunk is the zero key of the number pad (and not Tab). Open the trunk and put the artifacts in.</p>

<p>Next, you have to find some petrol. There are two cans that I know of, one in the northeast building of the car park (northeast corner of the garage) and the other in the east building of the grainery (southwest corner). Take one or both back to the Rookie Village, stand behind the car, and press the Del key (or period) of the number pad. If you have trouble figuring out which key it is, check the options. You can put both cans in the car so they don't count toward your backpack weight, or the weight limit of the trunk.Stand next to the car and press the F key to get in. Press the zero key on the number pad to start and stop the engine.</p>

<p>As you leave the camp, take the hill at an angle or you may not make it to the road. Then, turn left and drive to the bridge. Approach the commander from the south on the east edge of the road. Get as close as you can, then get out and take the artifacts out of the trunk. Give them to the commander and the weapons are automatically put in the car. Then, drive back and give them to Wolf, again, getting as close as you can. Give Wolf the weapons and go collect your reward from Sidorovich. If you ask for another special mission, he sends you to Agroprom to steal the case from the military.</p>

<h3 id="guitar">Find the guitar</h3>

<p>Sidorovich sends you out to find his guitar that he loaned out and never got back. Go to the entrance of the camp on the east side and jump up on the hood of the truck on the south side of the dirt road going into the camp. The guitar is on the seat. Take it back to Sidorovich for your reward.</p>

<h3 id="milanomaly">The military at the anomaly</h3>

<p>Sidorovich sends you back to the ravine where some soldiers are standing guard. Before you go, be sure you have three loaves of bread, two sticks of sausage, and a bottle of vodka. Go to the soldier on the northeast side of the ravine (closest to the bridge) and ask him what they are doing there. He will ask for the snacks, and if you don't have them, you have to go back to the village and buy them (if you can find everything). Once you give the soldier the snacks, he tells you that they found a rare artifact and are guarding it. Go back to Sidorovich and report. He then sends you back to steal the artifact, which is inside the rusted truck cab. Be sure you have some anti-rad before you leave the bunker. As far as I can tell, you have these options:
<ol><li>Kill all the soldiers, then go get the artifact.</li><li>Run in, grab the artifact, and run back out. Once you pick it up, you take on radiation, psi holograms spawn, and the soldiers start firing.</li><li>Go back to the soldier that you gave the snacks to and offer to get the artifact (1). Once you pick it up, you take on radiation, psi holograms spawn. Instead of bringing the artifact to the soldier, keep going until you can give it to Sidorovich. However, the soldiers follow and attack the village.</li><li>Go back to the soldier that you gave the snacks to and offer to get the artifact (2). Once you pick it up, you take on radiation, psi holograms spawn. Give the artifact to the soldier and walk away. Go back to the cement drain pipe, into the ravine, and use the large tank as cover to kill the soldiers. When you loot the soldier with the artifact, you don't pick up any radiation.</li></ol></p>

<p>Give the artifact to Sidorovich to complete the task and get your reward.</p>

<h3 id="mercs">Mercenaries at the Cordon</h3>

<p>Sidorovich gives you a microphone and sends you to the Garbage to listen in on the Merc's conversation. The hardest part of this task is avoiding detection. In the Garbage, it's best to start from the road in front of the Vehicle graveyard to avoid some heavy radiation in the lower area directly east of the graveyard. If the bandits are in near the road in the pile of cement blocks, you'll have to take them out so you can pass by along the south end of the swamp. Once you pass the swamp, turn northeast and head for the dead stalker. At the dead stalker, turn east and find two large green bushes. Go into the bush on the left, avoiding the anomaly on your right. As you near the bush you get an update, but continue into the bush to stay out of sight. Open your inventory and double-click the microphone that Sidorovich gave you. A timer starts and you have to stay undetected for about 50 seconds. When the timer runs out, you get another update to report back to Sidorovich.</p>

<p>When you get back to the bunker and listen to the recording, Sidorovich realizes the Mercs have planted a bomb somewhere in the Rookie Village and tells you to find it. As you leave the bunker and approach the village, a timer starts at 3:00. The only problem is, the location changes from game to game. So, these are the locations I've found so far:
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;"><li>Against the wall of the root cellar with the arched entrance along the north side of the road, behind a pallet.</li>
<li>In the bush next to the trailer with the tank along the south side of the road.</li>
<li>In the bush across from the well along the north side of the road.</li></ul></p>

<p>When you find the bomb, pick it up and pick the green wire. Then Sidorovich tells you to go kill the Mercs. Back to the Garbage and east of the swamp. Only, this time, stay along the south end of the wooded area, between the hills and tree line. The Mercs will be to the north of you, so make your way to the nearest tree so you have some cover. Throw a few grenades into the area where the Mercs are and, hopefully, wound them all enough that you don't have to fire a shot. Otherwise, you might get a grenade coming your way. When the last Mercenary is put down, you get an update to collect your reward from Sidorovich, which includes some  frag grenades and a really nice shot gun.</p>

<h3 id="elevator">Guest at the elevator</h3>

<p>After you have completed the first three "personal errands" you can get this task. When you get to the grain elevator, you get shot, but then there's a corpse suddenly in the southeast corner of the mill. If there are soldiers at the bridge, they can get you with a grenade, so try to stay out of thier site. Loot the body and pick up the sniper rifle to get an update that tells you to take the weapon to Sidorovich.</p>

<p>When you show the gun to Sidorovich, he recognizes the markings on the stock as Barkeep's and tells you to take the gun to him and ask why this guy is trying to kill you. When you confront Barkeep, he claims it's all a mistake and he was forced into arranging a hit on another stalker. Now that the sniper is dead, the deal may go south, leaving Barkeep in a bad spot. He sends you back to the Cordon to finish the job.</p>

<p>The target area is the Military Outpost at the north end of the Cordon. Wait near the gate where you can see the hitman crouching behind the wall. Sometimes he gets his target, and sometimes his target gets him. Either way, you have to finish the survivor off and go back to Barkeep to complete the task.</p>

<h3 id="set">Find the set of artifacts</h3>
<p>Ask Sidorovich if he has any interesting work and he gives you a list of "dummie" artifacts that you can collect while you move about the Zone. Most of these artifacts are found in stashes, so the best strategy is to loot every corpse, even if you know another stalker has beat you to it. For example, there's a Sponge, Battery, and Shell artifact in the Cache of Expedition-1 stash in Yantar. When you get the artifacts on the list, take them to Sidorovich and he gives you a SERAFIM suit.</p>

<h2 id="fox">Take Fox's docs to Sidorovich</h2>

<p>When you talk with Fox in Cordon, he tells you of a briefcase full of papers he wants you to get and give to Sidorovich. The briefcase is near the southeast corner of the Millitary Checkpoint. From the Rookie Village, go east until you reach the fence. Turn right (south) and follow the fence until you reach the mine field. Avoiding the white stakes, make your way to the fallen tree and use the tree to get over the fence. Now turn southwest and go to the eastern wall of the checkpoint. Find the large crate and rusted truck cab, and move along them to avoid the anomay. The briefcase in the bush next to the truck cab. Pick it up and take it back to Sidorovich to get your reward.</p>

<h2 id="wolf">Get Wolf the dynamite</h2>

<p>Ask Wolf why he's so serious and he tells you about a box of dynamite that he needs for an order. Tell him you'll find the box, then head northeast toward the derailed locomotive. The box is in the cab and accessible from the southeast (opposite the tracks). Take the box back to Wolf and collect your reward.</p>

<h2 id="old">Old man's daughter</h2>

<p>Inside the house where the car is parked in the Rookie Village is an old man looking out the front window, Prokhor. Talk to him to hear his account of the accident and about his daughter. You won't be able to go any further with this mission until you reach Pripyat. When you get to Pripyat, there's a marker on the west side of the map. I like to wait until I reach the hotel room, then go out the window onto the roof and sprint for cover from the RPGer to the north. Take him out and use the roof of the covered walk to get to the building west of the hotel. Work your way west to the appartment building and go to the south end of the building to find the stairs. Follow the hallway around and up the stairs to the top floor. Go right and follow the hallway on the right to find a doll and a diary. The task updates to Talk to the old man, which means you have to go back to Cordon.</p>

<p>Talk to the old man to learn what may have happened to the girl and complete the task. A message displays telling you that you can now sleep in the rain and the Zone will protect you.</p>

<h2 id="fellow">Help your fellow rookies</h2>

<p>This is actually a series of task and covers three maps. I prefer to take this task on when I complete the <a href="#old">Old man's daughter</a> task that takes me back to Cordon. The first task starts when you talk to Vasya Schukin in the house on the west end of the Rookie Village. He asks you to help him and his brother, Petya, retrieve something, but won't tell you what. Follow Vasya south over the hill to the refrigerator and talk to him again. Then, step back. When Vasya opens the door, he's blown up. Pretty soon another stalker comes over the hill named Troll, who explains that he booby-trapped the refrigerator. After the conversation with Troll, go back to Petya and ask if he's alright. Agree to escort him back to the house. This gives you the <i>Protect the youngest of the brothers</i> task.</p>

<p>Follow Petya back to the house. When Troll shows up, blow him away, which you can't do until he hits Petya at least once. But don't let Troll kill him or you'll fail the task. With Troll down, talk to Petya again and he tells you of a possible artifact in the train tunnel to the northeast. This gives you the <i>Inspect the tunnel</i> task. Go to the right side of the train cars to see colored lights bouncing around. Go over and pick up the toy bear, then open your backpack and double-click on it. Agree to help the bear find its owner, Kolya, and this gives you the <i>Find the stalker</i> task. Now go to the Bar and find named Tail, who might be able to tell you where Kolya is.</p>

<p>When you talk to Tail, he tells you Kolya went to the Dead City. Once you get to the Dead City, look on your PDA for the area circled north of the bridge and south of the water tower. When you find Kolya, loot his body and grab the Compass artifact. The Cheburashka says it needs the artifact, there's white stars for a few seconds, and then Kolya's body and the artifact are gone. The Cheburashka says that if you keep it, it will help you with other tasks and the task is complete.</p>

<h2 id="agrounder">Find Strelok's group's stash</h2>

<p>There's a few surprises in Agroprom. First, after you save Mole from the military and follow him to the underground entrance, you'll find that the entrance is blocked. Go northeast and follow the wall around (on the outside) until you get to a broken-out panel. Go through the opening and into the center of the four large tanks (Hermit's place in Clear Sky).</p>

<p>Next, when you get to Strelok's hideout, the flashdrive is in a different spot, but near the original place. And a bloodsucker spawns when you pick the flashdrive up.</p>

<p>Third, on your way to the underground exit into the Agroprom Research Institute, there are two controllers that spawn instead of one burer. Put a landmine near the doorway as you make your way down the passageway toward the manhole into the complex.</p>

<p>Finally, if you're like me and prefer to complete the <i>Find the militaries' documents</i> task without killing everyone in the camp, you'll find that there are more guards and they walk different routes. So far, I've gotten to the third floor without firing a shot. But there are two guards in the hallway and I haven't figured out a way to get past them unnoticed. Here's my walkthrough:
<ol><li>From the manhole out of the underground, low-crouch west to the dumpster and wait for two guards to pass.</li>
<li>Low-crouch south to the first shipping container and save.</li>
<li>Low-crouch south along the west side of the container and contiue west between the buildings.</li>
<li>Low-crouch south between the buildings staying along the west building and into the doorway.</li>
<li>Save again and wait for the guard to come from the south end of the building, past the doorway, and head for the front gate.</li>
<li>Low-crouch south to the fence around the storage tanks, then east until you get to the far curb.</li>
<li>Turn west and back up until you can just see which way the guard in the southwest tower is facing as he turns in a circle from left to right. You may want to take a step forward to be sure you're hidden by the tank.</li>
<li>When he turns north, crouch along the south wall of the main building and follow the wall to the left so that you're out of sight from the tower and save.</li>
<li>Crouch and take one step back, then jump forward to the window ledge and low-crouch in.</li>
<li>Low-crouch to the center of the room near the opening across from the front door and wait for the guard to go from left to right (east).</li>
<li>Low-crouch to the west stairs and save.</li>
<li>Wait for the guard to come back to the doorway of the stairs, then low-crouch up to the second floor.</li>
<li>The second floor has only one guard who comes in from the east stairs, looks out the front window, and then into the room. Move along the right-side wall to the crate and wait for the guard to go into the room.</li>
<li>Move to the east stairs and all the way up to the roof, being careful not to be spotted by the third floor guard.</li>
<li>Save and crouch back to the west stairs.</li>
<li>Low-crouch in and to the right along the rail where the baluster is missing.</li>
<li>Wait for the guard below you to start down the stairs and low-crouch of the ledge to the handrail below, then crouch through the doorway.</li>
<li>This is as far as I get without shooting. You should be able to take these two guards out, grab the box, and get back to the roof using the east stairs. Then, down the ladder and out the back fence.</li></ol>

<h2 id="mole">Find out what help Mole needs</h2>

<p>At some point during your time in Agroprom, usually after you find Strelok's flashdrive, Mole radios you to come see him. He's held up in the factory complex and may still be fighting the military. When you ask him what he needs help with, he tells you about a box of ammo he needs you to get for him in the Garbage Underground.</p>

<p>There are three boxes of ammo, each weighing 18 kg. So, strip down to your undies. Starting from the garage south of the depot, go down the ladder that's just inside the door, turn east, and then take the passage going north. In the bin on the right just before the two stacked truck tires is the first box. Continue down the passage until you come to an intersection and take that passage west. On the right are three large wooden crates with the second box of ammo on top. The third box is just a few steps more on the left.</p>

<div><b>NOTE:</b> The garage next to the depot is a safe place to park your car when you go to the Dark Valley. Taking it just gets in the way and you'll get another one while you're there.</div>

<p>The forth box of ammo is at the east end of the garbage heap on the east side of the road. You're going to take on some radiation, so bring some anti-rads, vitamin E, or artifacts of at least -50 radiation. The south side of the heap is curved in with a group of bushes at the southeast corner. Use that as a starting point to go north up to the top and find the white structure with a ladder going into a hole. Climb down the ladder and take your first anti-rad when you reach the first platform. The last box is at the bottom of the hole. There's a tunnel off the shaft to the east with a small room containing food and a record (which is part of an optional Barkeep task).</p>

<p>Take the ammo back to Mole and ask him to take the ammo. After he takes the last box, ask him what he'll give you out of the boxes and he offers you your choice as a reward.</p>

<h2 id="barkeep">Barkeep Optional Missions</h2>

<h3 id="friend">Bartender friend</h3>

<p>Ask Barkeep if he has any personal errands for you and he gives you this task as one of the options. This task takes you to the Dark Valley, so it's best to ask Barkeep for it before going on the X18 mission. Go to the bandit camp first where you'll see two corpses below the west tower. Take the sniper in the tower out and then go find the PDA next to the two dead stalkers. This tells you that Barkeep's friend is being held in a trailer, which is north of the factory. You can go up to the trailer, even inside, but it's best to find a good shooting spot. I prefer the retaining wall northwest of the trailer so the kidnappers are lined up for shooting. Once you start firing, a timer starts at 1:29. This is how long you have to stay alive and keep Barkeep's friend alive, too. Unfortunately, he comes out of the trailer and often gets killed. Once he's free, go talk to him and then you can go back to Barkeep for your reward.</p>

<h3 id="resolve">Resolve the situation with the prisoner at the Agroprom</h3>

<p>A very important stalker is being held by the military in Agroprom and you have to free him before the military finds out who he is. I've never tried this without a car, so I don't know if there's enough time to sprint from one side of Agroprom to the other. That would take a few energy drinks. Also, I like to use a shotgun with slugs, a sniper rifle for the guards in the towers, and a few grenades.</p>

<p>When you get to Agroprom, Barkeep radios you that a transport heli is on the way and you only have six minutes to get the stalker. This starts a timer at 6:00. Follow the road until you get to the truck in the road and turn left going just past the van. Pass the fallen tree to the left (east) and turn right to stay paralle with the fence. As you come over the hill, you'll see where another fence starts. Stay just to the right of it (so you're between the two fences) and go up to the top of the hill so you're south of the Agroprom Research Institute. Stop the car and take care of any mutants that may have followed you, then save. Take your sniper rifle and go north over the hill to the wall. Take out the guard in the west tower, then through the opening in the wall and toss a grenade toward the east gate. Keep it close to the building to set off a secondary explosion. Take out the guard in the east tower and sprint to the far-left window in back.</p>

<p>Switch to the shotgun and toss a grenade through the window so that it goes through the open door and lands in the hallway. After the grenade goes off, take one step back from the wall, crouch-jump to the window ledge, and low-crouch through the window. Toss another grenade into the hallway and get to the door, staying out of the blast field of the grenade. Check the hallway and outside the building, then sprint to the west stairs. Go up to the second floor and move carefully around the corner. Take out any guards in the hallway and the one guarding the stalker. Then, talk to the stalker and agree to lead him out.</p>

<p>The stalker does not follow until the hallway on the first floor is clear. When you get to the front door, don't be surprised by more soldiers spawning before your eyes as a helicopter flies over. When the way seems clear, tell the stalker to follow you and lead him out the front door and around back to the car. Get in the car and when you see the green indicator on your minimap, that means he's in the car with you (only you can't see him). Take him to Mole's group and talk to the stalker indicated on your minimap to complete the second part of the task. Then, go back to Barkeep for your reward.</p>

<h3 id="records">Records</h3>

<p>As Barkeep why there's no music and he asks you to keep an eye out for records. These are scattered around the Zone and can actually be found before taking the task. The only reward is listening to them when you bring them back to the Bar. Here is a list of locations:</p>

<ul style="list-style-type: disc;"><li>Cordon - In the attic of the abandoned farmstead house (where you meet Fox). Climb the ladder to the attic, then go through the hole in the southwest corner of the roof. Go up to the peak and east to the flat roof, then drop down into the hole in the southeast corner of the roof. The record is on the floor along the south wall.</li>
<li>Garbage - See the forth box in <a href="#mole">Find out what help Mole needs</a>.</li>
<li>Agroprom - On the third floor of the Institute building (military base), the east shelving unit.</li>
<li>Dark Valley - Borov's couch</li>
<li>Darkscape - As you escape from Dark Valley, there's a group of four houses and one of them has neutral bandits in it. First, go to the house on the other side of the road and to the east. Inside the front door is a pack of cigarettes. Pick them up and go talk to the bandit at the door. Tell him to let you in and he asks for a smoke. Give him the cigarettes, he eventually moves out of the way so you can enter. Go into the first room and to the far-right corner to find the record.</li>
<li>Army Warehouses - Inside the refridgerator across the hall from Lukash in the Freedom base. I found some references to another record somewhere in the farmstead north of the village, but haven't found it yet.</li>
<li>Dead City - On the ground floor of the building where messenger is. Sometimes the poltergeist throws it around, so you may have to look for it. Otherwise, it's on the table with the telephone in the room off the front entry to the west.</li>
<li>Pripyat - The building with the Monolith snipers just before you get to the car park. Go through the iron gate, into the front door, and continue east through the building. After you pass the open door and window on the right with the fire pit, turn right through the first door, then left and up the stairs. At the top of the stairs, turn left (south), go through the next room and into the room with the piano and the record on top.</li>
</ul>

<p>When you return to the Bar with one or more records, walk up to the juke box and press action to load them. You can listen to them if you want.</p>

<h2 id="plichko">Bring crossbow to Plichko</h2>

<p>When you first talk to Plichko, who guards the entrance to the Duty base at Rostok, and tell him you have valuable information for the commander, he offers this task. However, going to the Freedom base seems to be a waste of time because there's no way to get past the guy guarding the weapons. Talking to him doesn't work. I hit him with an RPG and didn't seem to hurt him, so you can't kill him. Unless you happen upon a crossbow in a stash, I'm afraid I can't help you with this one.</p>

<h2 id="voronin">Voronin Optional Missions</h2>

<h3 id="m202">Obtain a M202 from Freedom</h3>

<div><b>NOTE:</b> This is the same as the Bulldog 6 task of the vanilla version and you will even find VOG-25 ammo with the M202.</div>

<p>For this task, you need three bottles of vodka and preferably one kefir. Go to the guard at the entrance to the Duty headquarters and tell him Barkeep sent you for a special mission. After you talk to the guard, go to the left through the gate in the red brick wall, and then right into the guarded doorway. Follow the passage until you come to a room and go to the left to talk to Voronin. He tells you he wants you to steal an M202 rocket launcher from Freedom and gives you the task.</p>

<p>Go to the Army Warehouses and to the Freedom base. After crossing the bridge, turn right (west) and go to the end of the road. On the right is a long building that has a guy inside sitting on the floor near a post. Go in and talk to him, asking every question until you get to the one about having a drink. After two drinks, ask him about the M202, but he won't tell you. Then have another drink and ask again. This time he tells you there are two in the village. Now it's time for a kefir and stagger toward the village.</p>

<p>Go to the house marked on your PDA. The M202 is in the basement, along with some VOG-25 ammo. Take the M202 back to Voronin to complete the task.</p>

<h2 id="bolts">Find the anomalous bolts</h2>
<p>This task comes from Snitch in the Bar. When you bring some bolts back to him, no matter which option you take, he only gives you 100 RUs. And you have to trade with him to get it.</p>

<h2 id="x18">X-18 Documents</h2>
<p>Unlike the vanilla game, X-18 has documents all through it. The first one you encounter is near the first locked door. Turn away from the door facing north and take the second doorway on the right. Go through the room at a southeast direction and through the next door. Keep going until you find the hallway going north. On the right is a room with a Comet anomaly and a corse in the far corner. Loot the corpse to get Part 5.</p>

<p>For the next document, go down the hallway to get the code for the door, then take the hallway that goes west. Follow the hallway left past the large hole in the wall, then turn right and go into that next room. In the far-left corner is a stalker with #3 document. If you talk to him, he'll offer the document in exchange for an artifact. It's easier just to kill him and take it. However, he's pretty tough and it takes two-three grenades before he goes down.</p>

<p>Starting from the second locked door, go west through the room with the elevator down the hallway and turn left into the next room, and left again into a room with three large shipping containers. Make a U-turn to go past the containers and down some steps into a room with a large device hanging from the ceiling. On the far wall is a light blue stash box with the Part 1 document.</p>

<p>Part 2 is in the dark green stash box in the room where you kill the Pseudogiant and get the code for the second door. In the southeast corner are some stairs going up to a small room with a table and refrigerator. When you leave the complex, the military has left you two jeeps, one on either side of the front gate.</p>

<h2 id="ill">Help to seriously ill stalkers</h2>

<p>This is a good task to do along with <a href="#post">Find out what happened with post in Darkscape</a>. Also, good to have an RPG. Just north of the move point to the Wild Territory is a group of sick stalkers and a scientist named Malishev. Talk to him to find out about another scientist that's been kidnapped and held for ranson. This takes you to the south part of Darkscape, where you find the mercs holding the good doctor. As you approach an abandoned truck in the road, you are warned to proceed slowly. This is where you stop and talk to the leader, whose guarding the doctor in the barn. You have to agree to help them with an ambush before they let you take the doctor back to the Bar. This gives you the <i>Capture the officer</i> task.</p>

<p>You now have a detonator in your inventory that sets the bomb off when you double-click it. This is a good place to save because if the officer gets killed, the mission is over and the mercs do not release the doctor. Set the bomb off before the van reaches the other vehicles and then let the mercs take care of the guards. Go talk to the officer to get him to go into the barn. Then, an APC starts down the road and stops just before it reaches the first vehicle. If you have an RPG, hit the APC once in the side and let the mercs finish it off with their grenades. Otherwise, you'll have to toss a few grenades yourself.</p>

<p>When all the soldiers are dead, talk to the merc leader again to get the doctor released and some artifacts for your troubles. The mercs let the doctor go just up the road, north of the sick stalkers back at the Bar. Talk to him to learn he's afraid of a mutant and won't move. After the conversation, a bloodsucker spawns and attacks you. Kill it and tell the doctor the bloodsucker is dead to complete the task. He goes to the sick stalkers on his own.</p>

<p>However, the doctor remains a target on your PDA. Go talk to him again and he tells you he needs a Hive artifact. Tell the doctor you're ready to go and you get the <i>Find the Beehive artifact</i> task, along with an SSP-99 Ecologist Suit and a container for the artifact. The doctor then sends you to talk to the one stalker who isn't sick, who in turn sends you to Dark Valley. In Dark Valley, the island south of the Lab X-18 building is circled on your PDA. There you'll find a dead bandit with the artifact. Put the Eco Suit on and get the artifact. Keep the suit on until you get back to the doctor. Give him the artifact and he tells you that you've been infected, too. After he gives you a shot, the doctor tells you to keep the suit and gives you some artifacts as a reward to complete the task. The group soon leaves the area.</p>

<h2 id="sak">Sakharov Tasks:</h2>

<h3 id="post">Find out what happened with post in Darkscape</h3>

<p>This is a good task to do along with <a href="ill">Help to seriously ill stalkers</a>. This mission sends you to the train tunnel in Darkscape where you'll encounter a controller and some zombified scientists. The modders have it set so you can't jump up on the ledge to get into the west end of the tunnel. You have to go to the east side and jump across. Just watch out for the two bloodsuckers in the east tunnel. If you ignore them, chances are they won't notice you and you can save some ammo. Step up to the first ledge, then up into the tunnel, and once more onto the tracks.</p>

<p>There's two spots that I've jumped from successfully so far: sprinting along the narrow catwalk along the south side of the bridge and jumping to the bent beam, or going up the stairs on the north side of the bridge (usually need to jump up the stairs), crossing over to the south side, and sprinting along the top to jump to the other side. Either way, be ready for the controller to come out for you from a side door on the north, just inside the west opening of the tunnel.</p>

<p>In addition to the controller, there are three zombified scientists inside the doorway. When the way is clear, go to the back room to pick up a paper off the floor and loot the bodies of the two scientists that were not zombies to download their data. Then, report back to Sakharov to complete the mission.</p>

<h3 id="list">Materials for research</h3>

<p>Ask Sakharov if he needs any materials for his research and he gives you a list of artifacts and mutant parts that you can collect while you move about the Zone. This task does not come up on your PDA and the list only stays in your message history for a few hours (game time). So, you may want to take a screenshot of it. When you have one or more items, ask Sakharov if there is a special order for you. He gives you the current list. Tell him you want to check your stock and a dialog box opens. For each of the requested items you have, replace the zero with a one and give Sakharov the item. The reward is about three times the usual sale price of each item. Also, the list changes from time to time (about 20 hours game time) and Sakharov is only interested in the current items. 
</p>

<h2 id="lukash">Lukash Optional Missions</h2>

<h3 id="prisoner">Prisoners at the Radar</h3>
<p>Talk to Lukash and tell him he seems sad. He tells you his best scout is missing and you agree to look for him in Radar. When you get to Radar, take the first road off to the right (north) after the first four groups of Monolith. Finding the lost group is no problem as they're just standing behind the gate to the tunnel. However, when you talk to the leader you learn they've been fighting off mutants and haven't been able to leave. Just about this time you hear a beep and the leader warns you another wave of mutants is coming. This is the first of three, and I suggest saving between each. Go to the guard shack and when you see movement down the road, toss a grenade or two. If you're timing is right, you'll take out the boar before they get to the gate. Go back to the leader and talk some more before another wave, this time it's snorks. Same as before, you can take them out with a couple of grenades.</p>

<p>Back to the leader again, and again another wave, this time pseudogiants. If you have an RPG, two shots is about all you have time for, but it slows them down enough that the others can finish them off. When you talk to the leader again, he tells you about the door. Go look at the door and enjoy the show, then come back for the final attack. During this attack, stay with the leader next to the APC so the controller can't see you. You can't hold a weapon, so you have to wait for the others to kill the Master. That completes the task, and if you talk to the leader again, he gives you what he can for your help. Let Lukash know you found his men and he gives you a suit and some supplies.</p>

<h3 id="snitch">Deal with the snitch</h3>

<p>This task comes when you report back to Lukash that the Duty squad is taken care of. Lukash tells you he's got a snitch that he wants you to silence, but he also wants to know who the snitch is snitching to. Go to the farmstead north of the village. Quietly go up to the barn to hear the snitch contact his friends to tell them the coast is clear. After he radios them, you can pop him. Then, wait for the four mercs coming in from the west. Once they're down, report back to Lukash.</p>

<h3 id="btr">Get a BTR for protection of the Barrier</h3>

<p>Ask Lukash if he has any important tasks for you and he ask you to go to Dead City and find the military's abandoned BTRs. But first you need to talk to Screw, who is behind the headquarters building. Screw tells you about the key that you need for the BTRs and gives you the <i>Find the electronic key for the BTR</i> task and updates the <i>Get a BTR for protection of the Barrier</i> task. If the key task updates right away, check your inventory to see if one of the flash drives is actually a key. If you've already done the <a href="#Owner">Owner of the Dead City</a> task, chances are that you picked the key up when you got parts for the bomb.</p>

<p>If you don't have the key yet, go to Dead City and check the map for the crash site northeast of where you spawn. Then, go back to the bridge where you spawned from Yantar and go west, making sure you are on the south side of the fence. You will come to a pond where the BTR sits. Approach either side near the front and enter the vehicle with the action key just as you would a car. The <i>Find the electronic key for the BTR</i> task is complete and you now have the <i>Nothing works</i> task. Exit the BTR the same as a car, by turning sideways and hit action.</p>

<div><b>NOTE:</b> The BTR may be emission proof, but not snork proof. Snorks can kill you even when you're inside.</div>

<p>Back to the Army Warehouses to talk to Screw again. Fortunately, there's a move point northeast of your position that takes you directly to the warehouses. Unfortunately, it's a one-way move point and you have to go the long way around to get back to Dead City. Tell Screw you found the BTR and at the end of the conversation the <i>Nothing works</i> task is complete and you get the <i>Find a battery for the BTR</i> task, which takes you to the Garbage. The battery weighs 14 kg. so be sure you can carry that much weight before you go. Keep in mind that eventually, you'll be bringing the BTR to Lukash, so use a nearby stash if you need to.</p>

<p>Along the south side of the Vehicle graveyard are three red trucks. The battery is in the front seat of the middle truck. Go back to Screw and tell him that you found a battery. He tells you that it will take about six hours to get it ready. This is a good time to sleep, hunt for artifactgs, or clear the bloodsucker village. When the battery is ready, Screw gives you a can of petrol and a repair kit, too. 27.5 kg. in all. Now back to the BTR by way of Yantar.</p>

<p>When you get to the BTR, stand behind the left tail light to add the petrol (same keyboard command as a car). Next, open your inventory, double-click the tool kit, and click <i>car repair</i>. Now move up either side and enter the vehicle. The <i>Find a battery for the BTR</i> task is complete, but you now have the <i>The BTR computer is faulty</i> task. And yes, you guessed it, back to Screw.</p>

<p>When you tell Screw that there's another problem, he sends you to the Agroprom Institute to find a control module. You now have the <i>Get a new computer for the BTR</i> task. Only, instead of the Institute, go to the factory because there are no BTR parts at the Institute. At least, none that I could find. Go to the southest building in the complex, third floor, and find a trader. He will sell you the computer for 35,000 RU. I don't know how you're supposed to know to do this, but if it hadn't been for a video I happened upon, I'd have never figured it out on my own.</p>

<p>Back to Dead City one last time and enter the vehicle to complete the <i>Get a new computer for the BTR</i> task. Now drive the BTR back to the northeast corner of the Army Warehouses map. Take the BTR up the hill near the captain to complete the task. Talk to the captain and he tells you to go back and talk to Lukash. On your way to Lukash, you may notice that Freedom is now friendly to you. When you talk to Lukash, he gives you some really nice gear.</p>

<h2 id="psycho">Help Psycho</h2>

<p>You may want to wait to do this during the <a href="#well">Well-wisher: Take the case</a> task. The Insane stalker from the Freedom faction is actually very safe and you can talk to him. You can offer to take him to Sakharov for help and he becomes your friend. He follows you to the Wild Territory, but I can't get him to go past the train station platform. However, if I continue on, he's waiting for me when I spawn in Yantar. Take him to Sakharov, who claims he cannot help the poor guy. When the conversation is over, the stalker is waiting outside. Go talk to him and he ends the conversation by killing himself. Loot his body and take the flashdrive. His body then vanishes. The next time you sleep, you awake to find a note in your hand and a Morpheus artifact in your inventory. Double-click the note to download it into the Log page of your Diary, under Found PDA.</p>

<h2 id="well">Well-wisher: Take the case</h2>

<p>As you take your first steps in the Red Forest, you get a message telling you to go back to Yantar for a case. This is a detour from the original storyline, but one you must take. So, go back to Yantar and to the machine shop on the right side of the gate to the factory complex. The shorter way is Army Warehouses > Bar > Wild Territory. The safer way is Army Warehouses > Bar > Garbage > Agroprom. You may want to take on the <a href="#psycho">Help Psycho</a> task on your way back through the Army Warehouses.</p>

<p>When you get to Yantar, go in the front gate of the factory complex and turn right (north). There's usually three or four snorks waiting for you and there's, what looks like, a wood burner outside of the west wall of the machine shop. Jump up on there to deal with the snorks. Continue north and around to the open door of the shop. Go inside and note that there are mine sticks on the floor. Stay against the west wall and move south to the bench, where you'll find a note and a brief case. When you pick it up, you get a message from Well-wisher about booby traps and codes. A Monolith squad has been dispatched and is waiting outside the gate. If you're lucky, any stalkers nearby will take them out for you.</p>

<p>The note sends you back to Strelok's hideout in Agroprom. So, use the move point in the southwest corner of the map to get there. Once you're back in Strelok's hideout, go to the far (east) wall and pick up the note on the ledge at the end of the couch. This gives you the code to the brief case, but only part of the code to the Brain Scorcher is in it. You now have to find Messenger at the Army Warehouses. When you spawn in the Army Warehouses, your PDA shows the messenger in the nearby farm house. However, when you enter the house, you get a message that he's moved to Dead City.</p>

<div><b>NOTE:</b> Dead City gets pretty ugly after 21:00 and you can't leave. If you try, you get teleported back into the city. So, if you find it's getting late, head north over the bridge, past the guard shack, and turn northeast toward the building with four letters above the door and one laying on the ground. Either go in and through the building or around to the back and enter the closed door to the underground bar. Talk to the barkeep, Bosun, to get the <a href="#Owner">Owner of the Dead City</a> task.</div>

<p>You get to Dead City by going through the factory complex in Yantar. So, back to Yantar, again, and bring some anti-personnel mines with you. Go to the back of the factory complex just as you did to get to Lab X-16. All of the zombies you cleared out before are back, and they brought a controller with them. Instead of going into the X-16 building, turn west and go through the gate to get to Dead City.</p>

<p>There are two controllers here that you should take care of first. Go straight down the road until you get to the bus stop on the right. The controllers are in the building to the northeast (with the tall pillars). You can take them by surprise by sprinting up to the door and tossing a grenade or two in. Otherwise, use the bus stop shelter as cover to snipe them.</p>

<p>With the controllers out of the way, head for the building marked on your map to the west. But before going in, set some mines at each door and, if you see a poltergeist on the outside of the building, take it out. Then some more all over the ground floor. Be sure to spread them out so they all don't go off at the same time. Once you enter the building you can't exit. Also, be sure to pick up the note laying on the floor near the safe in the front of the building. Then, go upstairs and talk to the messenger.</p>

<p>Minor tells you the building is a spiral trap and you can't get out. However, the note you picked up has a clue about books. But first, you have to fight off all the zombies. The best spot is the landing overlooking the stairs in front. Just be sure to periodically check the hallway to the east for zombies coming in that way.</p>

<p>When the zombies stop coming, start collecting books:
<ol><li>The first is on the north side of the room where you met Minor, on the floor by the shelves.</li><li>Now, go down the hallway to the east and into the first room on the right. The second book is against the outside wall where the pipe runs floor to ceiling.</li><li>Next, go down the stairs and make three left turns until you come to the room with the stove and a cupboard. You can't open the cupboard, but you can pick up the book inside.</li><li>As you leave that room, follow the hallway on the left until you reach a bathroom opposite an outside door. Go into the bathroom all the way, stand on the toilet, and jump up to find the forth book in the tank.</li><li>Finally, go to the east side of the building, down the hallway and turn right at the end, and then into the first room on the left, which is another bathroom. The last book is on the floor next to the toilet.</li>
</ol></p>

<p>Now put the books into the safe. The safe vanishes and you can now leave the building. Go back upstairs and talk to Minor. He wants to go to the Army Warehouses before he gives you the rest of the code. There is now a move point to the Army Warehouses east of the building you're in. Along the way, you encounter a squad of Monolith. Lead Minor to the move point but stop at the bridge before you move. Talk to Minor and he'll give you the rest of the code. Just as a side note, the Dead City is definately worth exploring.</p>

<h2 id="household">Find the rest of the anomalous household items</h2>
<p>If you scout the appartment buildings in Dead City, you're bound to find some household items that have become artifacts. Picking up the first one you find gives you the task to find the others. As far as I know, anyone will buy them, but you have to take them to Sakharov to complete the task. Here are the locations, starting from the southwest corner:
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
	<li>Spoon - Southwest building > south entrance > first floor > far-left door > toilet.</li>
	<li>Doll - L shaped building west of town square > west entrance > attic > go east and drop into hallway. This building also contains the Midas artifact, which is 60 kg. and worth five million. From the doll, go through the doorway on the right and to the right side of the room. If you have trouble finding it, use an artifact detector to locate the doll. You should be able to see the glowing artifact and dead bodies to the right. Drop down onto the top of the wall and walk along the wall to get to the artifact.</li>
	<li>Jar - Gym roof. Use the ladder on the outside north wall at the east corner.</li>
	<li>Plate - Southern building east of gym > east entrance > top floor > center-left door > green tiled room.</li>
	<li>Bottle - Center building east of gym > west entrance > top floor > center-right door > bathtub.</li>
	<li>Kettle - Northern building north of bridge > east entrance > first floor > center-right door > green tiled room.</li>	
</ul></p>

<h2 id="Owner">Owner of the Dead City</h2>
<p>At the north end of the map is a bunker with a barkeep named Bosun that you need to talk to. To get there, head north over the bridge, past the guard shack, and turn northeast toward the building with four letters above the door and one laying on the ground. Either go in and through the building or around to the back and enter the closed door to the underground bar.</p>

<p>Talk to Bosun and suffer through the long story about the scientists. Then talk to Prokhorov, who should be sitting right by the bar, and he gives you his lengthy version of the story. When the conversation is finally over, you have the task. The first part of the task is to find the bodies of the scientists:
<ol>
	<li>North of the bridge in the farm house southwest of the water tower.</li>
	<li>In the storm drain east of the gym.</li>
	<li>Southwest appartment building > south entrance > top floor > left-center door > bath tub.</li>
</ol></p>

<p>The next part of the task is to find the Master's den. Look on the map to find the circled area just outside the city, directly west of the gym. Go to the northwest corner of the city to find a fallen tree and a hole in the fence. Go through the fence and north down the hill, past the dead bodies on the minimap, turn south and find the mine opening. As you go in, you get a message that your suit can't handle the radiation and you have to go back to Prokhorov. Talk to him and he adjusts the helmet that Sakharov gave you. This gives you a new task, <i>Explore the Master's den</i>. If you don't have a closed respirator suit, there are three of them on the ground floor of the gym.</p>

<p>Now you can go into the mine, under water, and follow the passage to find a scientist on his knees. Go talk to him and have a conversation with the Master. Now go back to Prokhorov again and talk to him. He decides to my a bomb and sends you to the crashed chopper, giving you the <i>Craft a thermite bomb</i> task. The chopper reckage is visible on the map, located in the southeast corner. Before you leave the bunker, make sure you can carry 40 kg. There's a safe/stash box by the pool table to put extra gear. If you haven't visited the crash site yet, there may be a bloodsucker lurking around, and possibly a couple of mercs.</p>

<p>The landing gear rim is near the front of the chopper and the aircraft skin is in between the two halves of the fuselage. Take the parts back to Prokhorov and wait for him to make the bomb. He says it will take about four hours, but it's more like six. When you get the task update, ask Prokhorov if the bomb is ready. He explains that you have about 2:30 delay before the bomb goes off.</p>

<p>Before you go sprinting off to the Master, let me explain how this next bit plays out so you can increase your odds of completing the mission. And don't expect to do it on your first try, or even your first dozen tries. Anyway, the only way to plant the bomb is to walk up to the zombified scientist and the bomb is pulled from your backpack. Immediately, things start spinning and you are transported to random parts of the map, where there's probably one or more zombies waiting to cap you. So, my strategy is to go to the appartment building in the northeast of the city (on the south side of the bridge) and clear out any zombies. Find a place in the stairwell to use the stairs as cover and shoot out the door. Then, watch the bioradar for zombies. Any zombie in the immediate area will come to you. When they stop coming, move to the gym and clear both floors. If there are any zombies on the bioradar, again, find some cover and wait for them to come to you. Finally, move west again to the first house, climb up the ladder, and kill zombies through the access hole.</p>

<p>You can continue clearing out zombies from the rest of the map if you want, but this is usually enough to complete the mission. Now head back to the Master. As you make your way to the Master, pay attention to where you are and what direction you're heading. You will need to rely on the compass to escape the Master's den. Just before you reach the zombified scientist, save. I've seen videos where they take some bi-psy-zon and vodka, but that doesn't seem to help. When you're ready, walk up to the zombified scientist until the bomb deploys itself and a timer starts and 2:28. You may get killed right away, or you may get transported in front of a zombie firing squad. But if you happen to get transported to one of the places you cleared out before, save. After a few seconds, you spin around again and are transported back to the Master's den. Start moving south toward the doorway, then through the doorway and north to the doorway on the east. You won't get that far before the next transport, but keep moving in that direction. Again, if you're transported to a safe place in the city, save. Then back to the den. Just keep moving toward the exit of the den.</p>

<p>If you're not out of the den when the timer runs out, GAME OVER. If you make it out, things go black, and then come back again. It is now safe to go back in the den if you want. Otherwise, head back to Prokhorov and talk to him. Now he wants you to escort him to the Cordon Checkpoint. When you get there, the task is complete and Prokhorov gives you some nice parting gifts.</p>

<h2 id="recall">Total recall</h2>

<p>After you beat Monolith and reach the last teleport, you find that the end is not the end. Instead, you are transported to the east side of the plant complex. Your PDA still has any tasks that you haven't completed, plus <i>Total recall</i>, which sends you back to Pripyat to talk to the Dark dealer. To leave the complex and get back to Pripyat, you have to the west side of the complex, and then south. Along the way you may encounter a Pseudodog or wounded Monolith, but mostly it's safe and you can sprint the whole way. The Exit puts you near the front (south) of the plant, but at the opposite end of the map than the move point.</p>

<p>Follow the road east until you come to a building with metal stairs that go over some large pipes. Go over the pipes and take the road on the right at the fork. Continue east when the road turns, go past the storage tanks and eventually you come to another buidling with metal stairs over some pipes. Again, stay right at the fork, but this time, stay on the road and go northease. This puts you directly in line with the open gate, or the hole in the wall, that you came in on at the start of the map. Once you're outside the complex, go south to the move point to Pripyat.</p>

<p>In Pripyat, go through the stadium, around the south side of the ferris wheel, cross the road, and go up the rubble to the second floor window to find Dark dealer. During your conversation with him, you have a medical episode and black out. When you come to, you remember everything and tell Dark dealer that you know where C-Consciousness has their main lab and want to kill them all. Dark dealer suggests that you get some help from either Duty, Freedom, or the Army. It is possible to involve all three. This gives you the <i>Prepare the assault on the C-Consciousness laboratory</i> task.

<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
	<li>Freedom - This takes you back to Lukash in the Army Warehouses and is the closes to Pripyat. If you've completed the <a href="#btr">Get a BTR for protection of the Barrier</a> task, Lukash will agree to help. Start the conversation with "I have something important to ask you." and then pick the second statement for each reply during the conversation.</li>
	<li>Duty - Go see Lukash in Rostok. He doesn't seem to care if you've done any extra tasks or not. This time, select the first statement in the first response, second statement in the second response, and alternate between the two to get Lukash's help.</li>
	<li>Army - This means going all the way back to Military Outpost in the southern part of Cordon. Go up the stairs and talk to Prokhorov who agrees to send air support.</li>
</ul>

<p>Now head for the Radars by way of Dead City. At the north end of the map, the tunnel that was radioactive is now a move point. The PDA has you going to a drain pipe, but before you go in, take out the Monolith in the towers. Just be sure to stay behind a tree because the all have Gauss rifles. Then, throw some grenades over the wall. You can try the front gate or the breech in the back wall if you have too much trouble going in through the drain.</p>

<p>When it's clear, go to the building in the center with the door facing the front gate. Go down the steps to trigger the traditional cutscene ending (which you can Esc out of). After the cutscene, a timer starts and another stalker waits at the door to tell you the military is planning a strike on the location. Click through the coversation as quickly as possible (you can read it in your PDA's Diary later) and sprint for the front gate, then southwest to the move point. Don't wait for the other guy, because he never makes it out. If you get to the move point in time, you spawn in Dead City and can free play.</p>
