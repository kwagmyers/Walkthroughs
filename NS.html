<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>This walkthrough is based on Narodnaya Solyanka Release 2018.</p>

<details>
<summary>Tips<span class="icon">&or;</span></summary>
<ul>
	<li>Many items, such as artifact, cigarettes, and mutant parts, are needed to complete some tasks. It's recommended to only sell ammo and, if you have more than one, weapons and suits. See <a href="#keepers">Items to Keep</a>.</li>
	<li>The Bar/Rostok is a central location in the first part of the game and a great place to store extra supplies. Once you get to Pripyat, consider moving your cache to Radar.</li>
	<li>Missions from various NPCs often involve the same location and I've done my best to gang them up together.</li>
	<li>Vodka makes you hungry and thirsty, so only use it for radiation when absolutely necessary.</li>
	<li>Most food makes you thirsty, with the exception of Tourist's Delight and mushrooms. It's best to wait and eat when the thirsty icon shows (or the hunger icon turns red) to make the most of your water supply.</li>
	<li>Beer helps thrist, but not as well as water. And never drink before going into battle.</li>
	<li>Artifacts have a limited lifespan while hanging on your belt. If you don't need it, put it in a backpack.</li>
	<li>All corpses are eventually removed, so don't use them for stashes unless it's for a very short time.</li>
	<li>Anomalies move when you leave a map and return. If you're cooking an artifact, you have to stay on the map until the cooking process completes.</li>
	<!--<li></li>

</ul>
</details>

<details>
<summary>Items to Keep<span class="icon">&or;</span></summary>

<ul>
	<li>Vodka - There are several characters who ask for it and it's only good as a last resort for radiation exposure.</li>
	<li>Blind dog tails - Tolik ask for five. You can sell the rest.</li>
	<li>TOZ-34 hunting rifle - At least two NPCs ask for this shotgun, Petruha and . There is one TOZ-34 in Kostya's first cache.</li>
	<li>Groza - Guide asks for this.</li>
	<li>Scientific Med Kits - Two NPCs each ask for 10, Fox and Fima. You can sell the rest.</li>
	<li>Beer - Bes ask for five cans of , which is in a Lab X-18 refrigerater. You can sell the rest.</li>
	<li>Pseudodog tails - Prapor asks for these.</li> 
	<li>Zombie hands - </li>
	<li>Bloodsucker tentackles - Prapor asks for tentackles from one Bloodsucker. You can sell the rest.</li>
	<li>Flesh eyes - Prapor asks for four. You can sell the rest.</li>
	
</ul>

<details>
<summary>Start<span class="icon">&or;</span></summary>
<p>You start the game near the crash of the death truck in Cordon with a Loner standing nearby named Astrologer. Talk to him and he sends you to the Northern farm to collect a stash, and then on to the Rookie village. Your ammo is limited, so avoid mutants for now. Use the pistol to open the stash, and head south toward the railroad embankment. You can bribe the military, as Astrologer suggests, or go up the enbankment west of the military to the fence and follow the fence east to the opening at the bridge. The anomaly doesn't harm you, just messes your vision up for a few seconds. Go west on the tracks and jump onto the shipping container between the box car and fence. This gets you over the fence so you can continue on the the Rookie village. However, if you do bribe one of the privates, I've read that you can do some work for the major. But the only time I tried, he either wouldn't talk or was dead (so I grabbed his Fort-14 to complete another vanilla Sidorovich task). Doc and Sidorovich are at the west end, just outside Sidorovich's bunker. Talk to Doc to get a dose of medicine that knocks you out. When you wake up, you're in the Cave.</p>
</details>
<details>
<summary id="cave">Cave<span class="icon">&or;</span></summary>
<p>You spawn with a teleport and campfire one way and an intersecting passage the other. You can see on the minimap that there is a neutral NPC just around the corner. Go talk to him (note that the passage closes behind you) and he takes you to Miner, who gives you the <i>Bring the container to Miner</i> task. You have some nice weaponry, but you can do this without firing a shot. In fact, you may want to drop some weight and take the Porcupine/Urchin artifact off your belt. You don't need it and it reduces your energy.</p>
<ol>
	<li>Take the first two lefts back the way you came in.</li>
	<li>Turn right into a large room (again, the passage closes behind you) and stay along the right wall. At this point, if you haven't started sprinting, do it now.</li>
	<li>Turn right again and follow the passage down an incline and past a campfire.</li>
	<li>Continue down the passage and left at the hanging sheer-black vegetation. Remember this spot as a transition to Garbage opens later in the game.</li>
	<li>At the campfire, turn right to see an Electro anomaly. Find the ladder and climb down (even though it doesn't go to the top).</li>
	<li>Sprint-jump over the right or left campfire and follow the passage to the container. Note that Miner told you not to kill the Fleshes, but they will attack.</li>
	<li>Picking up the container spawns a Bloodsucker, but you can sprint back to the ladder before it gets to you. Don't stop until you're up the ladder again.</li>
	<li>Follow your path back to the large room and go to the far-right corner.</li>
	<li>Turn left and follow the passage back to Miner, who then gives you some more medicine (in your backpack), sending you back to the Cordon.</li>
</ol>
</details>

<details>
<summary>Work for Sidorovich<span class="icon">&or;</span></summary>
<p>You wake up in one of the Rookie Village root cellars. Feel free to snatch the Playboy for an easy 169 RUs. Sidorovich is now in his bunker. Go talk to him and get the <i>Get the information from the scout</i> task of the vanilla SoC. On the way, be sure to help Tolik and get the <i>Find five dog tails</i> task from him. Also, search the soldier inside the trailer to start the <i>Find the military PDA</i> task. <a href="#Kostya">Kostya</a> is a new character that spawns in the Rookie village once you save Nimble and turn over the flash drive to Sidorovich. He stands in the fence opening on the south side of the road at the west end. Talk to him to get the <i>Find the cache in the Cordon</i> task. Next, talk to Wolf and get a Jellyfish artifact, which you can use if you got the <i>Find the Jellyfish artifact</i> task from Nimble. Note that Nimble's tasks are optional. There are other optional tasks you can easily complete to help build your inventory:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Ask Wolf what you can do to help and he gives you the <i>Bring the document to Wolf</i> task. The reward is an AKS-74U. This document is behind a mattress in the shipping container as you make your way through the tunnel with the moving Electro anomaly.</li>
	<li>Accept the <i>Find the Night Star artifact</i> task from Sidorovich, and sprint to get the artifact before another stalker beats you to it. The easiest way to find the artifact is to go through the tunnel under the road near where you found the injured Tolik. Continue southeast in a stright line and you should be able to see it not far from the tunnel in the valley south of where you first met Petruha. If it's not there, keep checking the area as you move around the Cordon. Night Stars are fairly common and you're sure to find one eventually. The reward is an eight-artifact container to store radioactive artifacts.</li>
	<li>Two tasks from the vanilla version are also available from Sidorovich: <i>Distroy the bandits in the Agroprom underground</i> and <i>Kill the bandit leader</i>. You have to do these two things anyway, so you might as well get something for it.</li>
	<li><i>Find a jacket for Nimble</i> is a matter of opening the manhole cover (Shift+F) on the south side of the train hanger near the crane, climbing down to get the jacket out of a backpack (that can be used as a stash box), and taking it to him.</li>
</ul>
</details>

<details>
<summary>Garbage<span class="icon">&or;</span></summary>
<p>From the Rookie village, make your way to the bus stop and find the Goldfish artifact that you'll need for another task. This artifact gives off radiation, so put it in the container you got from Sidorovich. Next, search the Mill for more supplies. Here you'll find Doc and Astrologer, but they don't have anything to offer at the moment. There are two fuel cans that you can sell to other stalkers (traders won't buy them).</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>Strelok's Hideout<span class="icon">&or;</span></summary>
<p>Meet up with Fox and follow the vanilla storyline to Bes, Seriy, Mole, and Strelok's hideout. I suggest that you wait to find <a href="#Kostya">Kostya's Find the cache in the Garbage</a> until you come back from Agroprom. In Strelok's hideout, find the grid that you can pick up (Shift+F), move it out of the way, and follow the passage into the next room. Loot the backpack on the bed and search the small safe up on top of the large electrical box. Find your way out of the underground and steal the case in the army base. I've tried to do this stealthfully, but it's easier just to sprint to the third floor. At some point you get a message from Gray, a trader who likes to drop in from time to time. If you're like me, you have a backpack full of weapons to sell, so his arrival is always welcomed. Also, if you offered to help Mole find his PDA, now is a good time to go into the train tunnel and fetch it.</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>Bar/Rostok optional tasks<span class="icon">&or;</span></summary>
<p>Help the Duty outpost with the mutants, <a href="#Kostya">Find the cache in the Garbage</a>, and talk to Prapor about Fox's weapon. See <a href="#Prapor">Prapor tasks</a> for additional information. Ignore the message from a wounded stalker for now. As you approach the gate you get an SMS from Baldy at the Bar. Continue on to the Bar, but be wary as you past the Duty checkpoint as there is an Avenger waiting to take you out. In Rostok, there is another Avenger lurking behind the small building on the right past the southern Duty checkpoint. In the Bar, talk to Baldy and get the <a href="#Baldy">Search for the treasure</a> task. This opens transitions from Garbage and Agroprom to Cave, where you met Miner. Other people to talk to are:
<ul>
	<li><b>Find the family rifle</b> - This is now in Darkscape and covered when we get there.</li>
	<li><b>Help Brom</b> - Also in Darkscape.</li>
	<li><b>Bring the Desert Eagle to Freeman</b> - This is in Wild Territory and covered when we get there.</li>
	<li><b>Bring the unusual artifact to Plichko</b> - This is part of <a href="#Baldy">Search for the treasure</a>.
</ul>
</p>
</details>

<details id="Baldy">
<summary>Search for the treasure<span class="icon">&or;</span></summary>
<p>Accept this task from Baldy at the Bar to open transitions to the Cave. This procedure starts at the Garbage train tunnel.</p>
<ol>
	<li>Go to the back of the tunnel to transition to the Cave. You spawn near the hanging sheer-black vegetation mentioned in <a href="Cave">Cave</a>.</li>
	<li>Go straight (west) and follow the passage left and up the incline.</li>
	<li>Take the first two lefts into the large room.</li>
	<li>Go to the far corner and turn left.</li>
	<li>Follow this passage, staying to the right, to Miner.</li>
</ol>
<p>Ask Miner for the Monolith fragment you left with him (on your first trip to the Cave) and he sends you to the Doctor. Miner also asks you to pick up a book in the Forgotten Forest. This is an easy task and presents the opportunity for more tasks.</p>

<p>Make sure you have at least three grenades before leaving the Bar and head for Dark Valley. You will probably pick up more along the way, but it's best to be sure. When you get back to Garbage, go directly to the Flea Market and up the fallen cement slab that now acts like a ramp on the north side. Make your way around to the bandit waiting to ambush you from the window ledge. At this point, the wounded stalker near the swamp isn't wounded any more and starts firing. Take him out and search him to get an update on the <i>Find the military PDA</i> task. At this point, a squad of Mercs spawns on the hill east of you. Use the nearby tree for cover, or sprint back to the Flea Market rubble. Once there down, head for the Bandit Base to get Borov's key, and follow the vanilla storyline until you clear out the X18 factory complex.</p>

<h2>Lab X18</h2>
<p>Unless you have an extra backpack, find a stash box before you enter X18 to put all of your artifacts (you can keep any that are in your container). See <a href="https://zsg.dk/Map_DarkValley.php" target="_blank">The Zone Survival Guide - Dark Valley</a> for options. It is also a good idea to take an extra backpack with you into the lab to store artifacts that you find there and can use on your return trip(s). When you enter the lab, all of your artifacts are taken by the security system. Don't use the corpse as a stash, either as it won't be there when you get back. If you still have artifacts and a backpack, you can store them before going through the security system. But first, you have to deal with the electrified bloodsucker. My strategy is to have a grenade ready and a shotgun in my primary slot as I walk down the factory steps toward the lab portal. Then I throw the grenade as soon as I hear the bloodsucker spawn, sprint back up the stairs while pulling out the shotgun. Most of the time, the grenade does the job, but you may need to finish the bloodsucker off with the shotgun.</p>

<p>The only real difference in the lab are the mutants. The refrigerator in the small room off the second-code room has 20 cans of beer. If you took the <i>Get beer for Bes</i>, he only wants five cans. You can sell the rest, or save them in case you run out of water. When exit the lab, don't plan on using the front gate as there is a BTR waiting for you to try. Instead, make your way to the roof. At the top of the last ladder, turn left (north) and jump onto the red metal roof. Cross the roof and sprint-jump into the tree. Hopefully, you'll land on a branch, but any damage you take shouldn't kill you. Now west across the road and either around or through the swamp. Cross the road again and stay low as there are bandits in the pig farm. As you approach the gate to Darkscape, another BTR approaches with a support squad. Use a tree as cover and start throwing grenades. Two or three grenades is all you need to take out the BTR.</p>

<h2>Darkscape</h2>
<p>When you spawn in Darkscape, there's a while Lada waiting for you. If you are not familiar with operating zone vehicles, the controls are listed in main Options with the exception of braking, which is the space bar. Also, you may need to assign the Start Engine control in the General section. For a bonus stash, stop on the bridge and walk toward the pumping station on the left (north). Just to the right of the pumping station is a cave with a dead bandit and a backpack with goodies. Check your PDA for the locations of any optional tasks you may have. Several Cordon NPCs have relocated to Darkscape and now is a good time to give them the items they requested. To retreave Hunter's family rifle, there is a mining shaft that opens directly south of the target. You can also get there from the broken train bridge, but it's a long walk. When you're ready to leave Darkscape, follow the road into the tunnel and portal back to the Cordon.</p>

<h2>Cordon II</h2>
<p>Sidorovich greets you with the usual, "...stop by and we'll chat." You can take the <i>Steal the box from the outpost</i> task if you want. But wait to get the box for now and head back to the Garbage. At this point in the game, you can either leave the Lada at the northern checkpoint, or go back to Darkscape, Dark Valley, and then to Garbage. I like to take the tasks of a new trader, Akim, in the northern checkpoint and leave the Lada there (out of the way of mutants and NPCs). Use either the tunnel, or go east along the tracks and around the fence, which ends about halfway between the bridge and tunnel, and over the tracks.</p>

<h2>Cave II</h2>
<p>For this next task, you need penty of small arms ammo. You will encounter a lot of biting cockroaches. A good sniper rifle will be handy, too. You may be able to pick up some 7.62 and 9x39 caliber ammo along the way.</p>

<p>The train tunnel in the Garbage has no anomalies, so you can sprint past any bandits and zombies to the back of the tunnel to the Cave portal. You spawn near the hanging sheer-black vegetation near the large room, which is up the incline and turn left. Go back to Miner and ask for the artifact back. He tells you that Doc has it. Ask him how to leave the Cave and he offers you the <i>Get the book for Miner</i> task. Again, this is an easy task adn you really don't need any weapons for this. Go back out to the Garbage and to the Forgotten Forest portal east of the Cordon portal. In the Forgotten Forest, turn right (south) and follow the edge of the map until you get to a crashed helicopter near the southwest corner of the map. Find the book within the pile of bones and quickly take cover behind the boulders. A military squad spawns, but will walk away if they don't see you. Wait for them to clear the area, then sprint back to the Garbage portal. Return the book to Miner and ask if there is anything else you can help him with. He then gives you the <i>Free the captive</i> task. Along the way we can pick up Baldy's treasure.</p>
<ol>
	<li>Go back to the spot where you picked up the container during your first trip to the Cave.</li>
	<li>Go right and right again. There are numerous mutants here, including up to four bloodsuckers. Just use the same tactic as with the electrified bloodsucker in Dark Valley. Killing a flesh doesn't seem to harm your reputation with Miner.</li>
	<li>Once the way is clear, follow the passage to the three stalagmites surrounded by Heat anomalies.</li>
	<li>Break the clay jar to find Baldy's coins.</li>
	<li>Now back to the end of the passage and turn right (away from the ladder).</li>
	<li>Follow the passage until you get to an intersection with two campfires.</li>
	<li>Turn right at the first campfire, and right again. The passage takes you in a spiraling circle, but eventually you get to the Labyrinth portal.</li>
	<li>In the Labyrinth, there are two Burers waiting just ahead. Take them out and continue forward. Eventually, you come to a large room with Monolith snipers on ledges, and a few on the ground.</li>
	<li>Turn left and follow the wall until you see another passage on the left.</li>
	<li>Follow the passage up to the next level. This is where the prisoner is kept and you'll be able to hear him calling for help.</li>
	<li>Go to the center of the level and turn right.</li>
	<li>Go over a walkway to the outerledge and take the passage on the right. This is a long way up to the next level with a bloodsucker along the way that you can probably out run.</li>
