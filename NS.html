<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>This walkthrough is based on Narodnaya Solyanka Release 2018. If you're looking for a specific task, see the <a href="#character">Tasks by Character</a> section.</p>
<!--Tips-->
<details>
<summary>Tips<span class="icon">&or;</span></summary>
<ul>
	<li>Many items, such as artifact, cigarettes, and mutant parts, are needed to complete some tasks. It's recommended to only sell ammo and, if you have more than one, weapons and suits. See <a href="#keepers">Items to Keep</a>.</li>
	<li>The Bar/Rostok is a central location in the first part of the game and a great place to store extra supplies. Once you get to Pripyat, consider moving your cache to Radar.</li>
	<li>Missions from various NPCs often involve the same location and I've done my best to gang them up together.</li>
	<li>Vodka makes you hungry and thirsty, so only use it for radiation when absolutely necessary.</li>
	<li>Most food makes you thirsty, with the exception of Tourist's Delight and mushrooms. It's best to wait and eat when the thirsty icon shows (or the hunger icon turns red) to make the most of your water supply.</li>
	<li>Beer helps thirst, but not as well as water. And never drink before going into battle.</li>
	<li>Artifacts have a limited lifespan. I'm not sure if it's just while hanging on your belt or not. So, if you don't need it, put it in a backpack.</li>
	<li>All corpses are eventually removed, so don't use them for stashes unless it's for a very short time.</li>
	<li>Anomalies move when you leave a map and return. If you're cooking an artifact, you have to stay on the map until the cooking process completes.</li>

<!--Items to Keep-->
<details>
<summary>Items to Keep<span class="icon">&or;</span></summary>
<p>My suggestion is to have a separate backpack or stash box for these items. I can't tell you how many times I've sold one of these items by mistake and had to roll back to a previous save.</p>
<ul>
	<li>AEK-971 - <a href="#Matvei">Matvei Kulinar</a> asks for this rifle.</li>
	<li>Anomalous Bison - <a href="#Cross">Cross</a> asks for five.</li>

	<li>Blind dog tails - Tolik ask for five.</li>
	<li>Bloodsucker tentacles - Prapor asks for tentacles from three Bloodsuckers. Keep two more for PDA modification by the Associate Professor. This enhancement is very helpful.</li>

	<li>Moonlight artifact - These are used to power the <a href="#URT">URT</a> found in <a href="#X-8">X-25</a>. Save them, and avoid putting them on your belt as this causes artifacts to become cobblestones after awhile.</li>
	<li>Night Star artifact - <a href="#Sidorovich">Sidorovich</a> and <a href="#Kalmyk">Kalmyk</a> each ask for one.</li>
	<li>PDAs - The Associate Professor requires these along with mutant parts to enhance your PDA. These enhancements show Bloodsuckers, Pseudogiants, and Controllers. These enhancements are very helpful.</li>

	<li>Television - There is a television in the Cordon Military Outpost that is required by </li>
	<li>TOZ-34 hunting rifle - At least two NPCs ask for this shotgun, Petruha and <a href="#Matvei">Matvei Kulinar</a>. There is one TOZ-34 in Kostya's first cache. You may also pick another one up off a Bandit (Just one more reason to kill them).</li>
	<li>Tourist's Delight - <a href="#Skinflint">Skinflint</a> asks for five.</li>
	<li>Uzi - <a href="#Matvei">Matvei Kulinar</a> asks for one. You might get one as a reward, or find one. These are hard to come by, so if you get one, keep it.</li>
	<li>Vodka - There are several characters who ask for it and it's only good as a last resort for radiation exposure.</li>
	<li>VSSK Exhaust rifles - <a href="#Matvei">Matvei Kulinar</a> asks for two, which are in Le Havre's Unexplored Land stash.</li>

</ul>	
</details>
<!--Start-->
<details>
<summary>Start<span class="icon">&or;</span></summary>
<p>You start the game near the crash of the death truck in Cordon with a Loner standing nearby named Astrologer. Talk to him and he sends you to the Northern farm to collect a stash, and then on to the Rookie village. Your ammo is limited, so avoid mutants for now. Use the pistol to open the stash, and head south toward the railroad embankment. You can bribe the military, as Astrologer suggests, or go up the embankment west of the military to the fence and follow the fence east to the opening at the bridge. The anomaly doesn't harm you, just messes your vision up for a few seconds. Go west on the tracks and jump onto the shipping container between the box car and fence. This gets you over the fence so you can continue on the the Rookie village. You can also go southeast and cross the tracks where the fence ends. But you'll have to deal with Bandits, Military, and radiation. If you do bribe one of the privates, I've read that you can do some work for the major. But the only time I tried, he either wouldn't talk or was dead. Doc and Sidorovich are at the west end, just outside Sidorovich's bunker. Talk to Doc to get a dose of medicine that knocks you out. When you wake up, you're in the Cave.</p>
</details>
<!--Cave-->
<details id="cave">
<summary>Cave<span class="icon">&or;</span></summary>
<p>You spawn with a teleport and campfire one way and an intersecting passage the other. You can see on the minimap that there is a neutral NPC just around the corner. Go talk to him (note that the passage closes behind you) and he takes you to Miner, who gives you the <a href="#Miner">Bring the container to Miner</a> task. You have some nice weaponry, but you can do this without firing a shot. In fact, you may want to drop some weight and remove any artifacts that reduce your energy.</p>
<ol>
	<li>Take the first two lefts back the way you came in.</li>
	<li>Turn right into a large room (again, the passage closes behind you) and stay along the right wall. At this point, if you haven't started sprinting, do it now.</li>
	<li>Turn right again and follow the passage down an incline and past a campfire.</li>
	<li>Continue down the passage and left at the hanging sheer-black vegetation. Remember this spot as a transition to Garbage opens later in the game.</li>
	<li>At the campfire, turn right to see an Electro anomaly. Find the ladder and climb down (even though it doesn't go to the top). Use the nearest and furthest campfire to help align with the ladder and avoid a fall.</li>
	<li>Sprint-jump over the right or left campfire and follow the passage to the container. Note that Miner told you not to kill the Fleshes, but they will attack.</li>
	<li>Picking up the container spawns a Bloodsucker, but you can sprint back to the ladder before it gets to you. Don't stop until you're up the ladder again.</li>
	<li>Follow your path back to the large room and go to the far-right corner.</li>
	<li>Turn left and follow the passage back to Miner, who then gives you some more medicine (in your backpack), sending you back to the Cordon.</li>
</ol>
</details>
<!--Work for Sid-->
<details>
<summary>Work for Sidorovich<span class="icon">&or;</span></summary>
<p>You wake up in one of the Rookie Village root cellars. Feel free to snatch the Playboy for an easy 169 RUs. Sidorovich is now in his bunker. Go talk to him and get the <i>Get the information from the scout</i> task of the vanilla SoC. On the way, be sure to help Tolik and get the <i>Find five dog tails</i> task from him. Also, search the soldier inside the trailer to start the <i>Find the military PDA</i> task. <a href="#Kostya">Kostya</a> is a new character that spawns in the Rookie village once you save Nimble and turn over the flash drive to Sidorovich. He stands in the fence opening on the south side of the road at the west end. Talk to him to get the <i>Find the cache in the Cordon</i> task. Next, talk to Wolf and get a Jellyfish artifact, which you can use if you got the <i>Find the Jellyfish artifact</i> task from Nimble. Note that Nimble's tasks are optional. There are other optional tasks you can easily complete to help build your inventory:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Ask Wolf what you can do to help and he gives you the <i>Bring the document to Wolf</i> task. The reward is an AKS-74U. This document is behind a mattress in the shipping container as you make your way through the tunnel with the moving Electro anomaly.</li>
	<li>Accept the <i>Find the Night Star artifact</i> task from Sidorovich, and sprint to get the artifact before another stalker beats you to it. The easiest way to find the artifact is to go through the tunnel under the road near where you found the injured Tolik. Continue southeast in a straight line and you should be able to see it not far from the tunnel in the valley south of where you first met Petruha. If it's not there, keep checking the area as you move around the Cordon. Night Stars are fairly common and you're sure to find one eventually. The reward is an eight-artifact container to store radioactive artifacts.</li>
	<li>Two tasks from the vanilla version are also available from Sidorovich: <i>Destroy the bandits in the Agroprom underground</i> and <i>Kill the bandit leader</i>. You have to do these two things anyway, so you might as well get something for it.</li>
	<li><i>Find a jacket for Nimble</i> is a matter of opening the manhole cover (Shift+F) on the south side of the train hanger near the crane, climbing down to get the jacket out of a backpack (that can be used as a stash box), and taking it to him. Be sure to take it with you when you go to Lab X-18 as you'll end up in Cordon and can save yourself an extra trip.</li>
</ul>
<p>From the Rookie village, make your way to the bus stop and find the Goldfish artifact that you'll need for another task. This artifact gives off radiation, so put it in the container you got from Sidorovich. Next, search the Mill for more supplies. Here you'll find Doc and Astrologer, but they don't have anything to offer at the moment. There are two fuel cans that you can sell to other stalkers (traders won't buy them).</p>
</details>
<!--Strelok's Hideout-->
<details>
<summary>Strelok's Hideout<span class="icon">&or;</span></summary>
<p>Meet up with Fox and follow the vanilla storyline to Bes, Seriy, Mole, and Strelok's hideout. If you save Yurik from the Bandits when you first entered Garbage, you can pick up the gun on your way to Agroprom. Just be sure to have it with you when you head for Lab X-18. I suggest that you wait to find <a href="#Kostya">Kostya's Find the cache in the Garbage</a> until you come back from Agroprom. Also, while in Garbage you may get a message from a wounded stalker asking for help. Or, this may come when you return. This is really a Bandit ambush, and there may be another Bandit hidden in the Flea Market. Take them both out and when you approach the Bandit calling for help, you get a text message about Mercenaries in the area. They spawn on the hill east of the Bandit. You can sprint back to the Flea Market and use the rubble for cover. The Bandit calling for help has the Wounded Bandit's PDA, which is added to your PDA's Diary under <i>Search for the missing scientists</i> and the <i>Find the military PDA</i> task is updated to show that you now need to find the Bandit (Friar) who ripped off this Bandit. This is what I love about Bandits, they don't care about each other at all. You kill one and another comes to loot the dead, never checking to see what, or who, killed them.</p>

<div>If you take Fox's task for medkits, he only accepts the red ones. He asks about Army Medkits, but even if you have them he only takes the red ones. Also, whenever you enter the Agroprom Underground, it's a good idea to check both ends of the traveling Electro anomaly for artifacts.</div>

<p>In Strelok's hideout, find the floor grid that you can pick up (Shift+F), move it out of the way, and follow the passage into the next room. Loot the backpack on the bed and search the small safe up on top of the large electrical box. Find your way out of the underground and steal the case in the army base. I've tried to do this stealthily, but it's easier just to sprint to the third floor. At some point you get a message from Gray, a trader who likes to drop in from time to time. If you're like me, you have a backpack full of weapons to sell, so his arrival is always welcomed. Also, if you offered to help Mole find his PDA, now is a good time to go into the train tunnel and fetch it.</p>
</details>
<!--Bar tasks-->
<details>
<summary>Bar/Rostok tasks<span class="icon">&or;</span></summary>
<p>Help the Duty outpost with the mutants, <a href="#Kostya">Find the cache in the Garbage</a>, and talk to Prapor about Fox's weapon. See <a href="#Prapor">Prapor tasks</a> for additional information. Ignore the message from a wounded stalker for now. As you approach the gate you get an SMS from Baldy at the Bar. Continue on to the Bar, but be wary as you past the Duty checkpoint as there is an Avenger waiting to take you out. In Rostok, there is another Avenger lurking behind the small building on the right past the southern Duty checkpoint. In the Bar, talk to Baldy and get the <a href="#Baldy">Search for the treasure</a> task. This opens transitions from Garbage and Agroprom to Cave, where you met Miner. Other people to talk to are:
<ul>
	<li><b>Find the family rifle</b> - This is now in Darkscape and covered <a href="#Hunter">here</a>.</li>
	<li><b>Help Brom</b> - Also in Darkscape and covered <a href="#Brom">here</a>.</li>
	<li><b>Bring the Desert Eagle to Freeman</b> - This is in Wild Territory and covered <a href="#Freeman">here</a>.</li>
	<li><b>Bring the unusual artifact to Plichko</b> - This is part of <a href="#Baldy">Search for the treasure</a>.</li>
</ul>
</p>
</details>
<!--Baldy-->
<details id="Baldy">
<summary>Search for the treasure<span class="icon">&or;</span></summary>
<p>Accept this task from Baldy at the Bar to open transitions to the Cave. This procedure starts at the Garbage train tunnel.</p>
<ol>
	<li>Go to the back of the tunnel to transition to the Cave. You spawn near the hanging sheer-black vegetation mentioned in <a href="Cave">Cave</a>.</li>
	<li>Go straight (west) and follow the passage left and up the incline.</li>
	<li>Take the first two lefts into the large room.</li>
	<li>Go to the far corner and turn left.</li>
	<li>Follow this passage, staying to the right, to Miner.</li>
</ol>
<p>Ask Miner for the Monolith fragment you left with him (on your first trip to the Cave) and he sends you to the Doctor. Miner also asks you to pick up a book in the Forgotten Forest. This is an easy task and presents the opportunity for more tasks. But first, we need to get Baldy's treasure and Plichko's artifact.</p>
<ol>	
	<li>Follow the steps in <a href="Cave">Cave</a> to the point where you climb down the ladder.</li>
	<li>Go right and right again. There are numerous mutants here, including up to four bloodsuckers. So, start throwing grenades. Killing a flesh doesn't seem to harm your reputation with Miner.</li>
	<li>Once the way is clear, follow the passage east, then south to the three stalagmites surrounded by Heat anomalies.</li>
	<li>Break the clay jar to find Baldy's coins. NOTE: There have been occasions where the jar wasn't visible and I had to walk around the bones (without stepping into an anomaly) until I actually kicked it. Then it appeared.</li>
	<li>Now back to the end of the passage (and campfire) and turn right (north).</li>
	<li>Follow the passage until you get to an intersection with two campfires.</li>
	<li>Turn right at the first campfire and continue south until you see another ladder.</li>
	<li>Take the ladder up and notice the small hole to the left. As you approach, some rats spawn. Take them out quickly, or they'll do the same to you.</li>
	<li>Go through the hole and work your way through the anomalies until you come to the Emerald artifact (sometimes there are two).</li>
	<li>In the large room, take the passage on the right. When you encounter an Electro anomaly block your path, throw a bolt into it and sprint through as it discharges.</li>
	<li>Continue to an opening to the right where a small stash box may have something for you. This passage takes you back to the large room.</li>
	<li>Take the passage in the southeast corner and turn left at the next intersection.</li>
	<li>Follow this passage and turn right at the campfire to go back to the Garbage transition.</li>
</ol>
<p>You can return to Baldy and Plichko if you want, or go directly to Dark Valley. The Garbage to Forgotten Forest transition isn't available yet to <i>Get the book for Miner</i>. This transition opens when you return Fox's gun.</p>
</details>
<!--X-18-->
<details id="X18">
<summary>Lab X-18<span class="icon">&or;</span></summary>
<p>Again, be sure you have Fox's gun, Yurik's gun, and Nimble's jacket. Head for the Dark Valley Bandit Base to get Borov's key, and follow the vanilla storyline until you clear out the X-18 factory complex. Note that Borov has a document, "Borov's Notes" that mentions Rat. This task does not show on your PDA, but is addressed <a href="#Rat">here</a>. Before entering the lab, put all artifacts in one of the stash boxes. I recommend the stash box in the trailer near the northeast corner of the factory. When you enter the lab, all of your artifacts are taken by the security system. Don't plan on using the corpse just inside the lab as a stash, as it won't be there when you get back. If you do have an extra backpack, it's a good idea to take it with you into the lab to store artifacts that you find there and can use on your multiple return trips.</p>

<p>But first, you have to clear out the factory complex. As you do, you may notice a neutral character in the south building. This is Messer and, if you kill his guards and give him a med kit, he gives you information on a Snotty Porcupine. You may also find the Bandit who stole the Military PDA. If not, he'll show up eventually. Once you find him, refer to <a href="#Prapor">Get 10 scientific kits for Prapor</a>. With the complex cleared of Bandits, you now have to deal with the electrified bloodsucker guarding the lab door. My strategy is to have a grenade ready as I walk down the steps toward the lab. Then I throw the grenade as soon as I hear the bloodsucker spawn (about halfway down the first hallway), and sprint back up the stairs while pulling out the shotgun. Most of the time, the grenade does the job, but you may need to finish the bloodsucker off with the shotgun. Just don't let it get too close. It's like a running Electro anomaly.</p>

<p>Check the dead stalker for the note to Kolya. The only real difference in the lab are the mutants and a <i>Notepad with entries</i> on the first dead scientist. Also, break the mirror in the lavatory next to the first dead scientist to get the <i>Military Note</i>. This is not listed on your PDA Tasks, but in Diary under <i>Personal notes through searching > Search for Kalugin</i>. On the second level of the lab, in the small room off the room with the second dead scientist, the refrigerator has 20 cans of beer. If you took the <i>Get beer for Bes</i>, he only wants five cans. You can sell the rest, or save them in case you run out of water.</p>

<div>From the bottom of the second-level stairs, take the left hallway to the end and turn right into a room with lockers and a document on top. This is a Simbion artifact recipe that you may need later. Pick it up and find it on the PDA's Encyclopedia page under Recipes.</div>

<p>Now kill the Pyrogeist and grab the document. When you exit the lab, don't plan on using the front gate as there is a BTR waiting. Instead, go to the northeast corner and use the boxes to jump to the pipe on the north wall, and then out the window. Now west across the road and either around or through the swamp. Cross the road again and stay low as there are Bandits in the pig farm. As you approach the gate to Darkscape, another BTR approaches with a support squad. Use a tree as cover and start throwing grenades. Two or three grenades is all you need to take out the BTR.</p>
</details>
<!--Brom-->
<details id="Brom">
<summary>Help Brom<span class="icon">&or;</span></summary>
<p>When you spawn in Darkscape, there's a white Lada waiting for you just up the road on the left. If you are not familiar with operating zone vehicles, the controls are listed in main Options with the exception of braking, which is the space bar. Also, you may need to assign the Start Engine control in the General section. Also, if the Lada gets on its side, turn the wheel toward the ground and go forward to get back on all four tires. For a bonus stash, stop on the bridge going over the  creek and walk toward the pumping station on the left (north). Just to the right of the pumping station is a cave with a dead Bandit and a backpack with goodies.</p>

<div>At some point your PDA quits on you and you must go to the Bar and have the Associate Professor fix it. You must give Garik a candy bar to get past him, and then step back so he can move away from the door.</div>

<p>The Bandits are camped in a fuel station located in the southeast corner of the map. If you approach from the west, you may be able to get into the building and out again without firing a shot. Find the main hallway going west and take the last doorway on the right. Go all the way to the last office and find the safe. Notice that the door is open just enough so that you can lean left to see the case on the top shelf. Grab it and take the road west until you come to a tree partially blocking the road. On the other side of the tree are some stalkers, including Bes, Mole, and possibly Fox. Give Bes his beer and ask if there is another job. He gives you the <i>Bring Bes the box of ammo</i> task. The ammo is on the tail section of the helicopter on the north side of the Vehicle Graveyard. Give Mole his PDA. If Fox is not at the campfire with Mole, check your PDA to see if he's on his way. You may be able to meet him on the road. When you give Fox his gun, the Garbage to Forgotten Forest opens and you can <a href="#Miner">Get the book for Miner</a> when we get back to Garbage.</p>
</details>
<!--Hunter-->
<details id="Hunter">
<summary>Find the family rifle<span class="icon">&or;</span></summary>
<p>To retrieve Hunter's family rifle, there is a mining shaft that opens directly north of Bes' camp. You can also get there from the west side of the broken train bridge, but it's a long walk. Coming from the south, follow the passage to a large opening with civilian zombies. To the right is a passage leading to the rifle, which is guarded by four armed zombies and a controller. Find the rifle in the center of the area on a table. Be sure to collect as many zombie hands as you can. You will soon be getting a request for 10.</p>

<p>Check your PDA for Yurik and take him the modified MP5. Ask if he has any more work, and he asks you for a Burer hand (which you probably have from X-18). When you're ready to leave Darkscape, follow the road west into the tunnel and transport back to the Cordon. Sidorovich greets you with the usual, "...stop by and we'll chat." only it's in Russian. Wait to take the <i>Steal the box from the outpost</i> task. Give Nimble his jacket and head back to the Garbage. At this point in the game, you can either leave the Lada at the Military Outpost, or go back to Darkscape, Dark Valley, and then to Garbage. This might be a good time to grab <a href="Akim">Akim's document</a> and Bes' ammo. Since you're close to Akim, take the document to him and get the <i>Bring old documents to Akim, pt. 2</i> task.</p>

<p>There are a couple of items to take care of before moving on. We need to get <a href="#Akim">Akim's second document</a> and open the Rostok to ATP transition. Go back to the factory where you first met Mole and introduce yourself to Adrenaline, who is a trader on the second floor of the southeast building. Ask if he knows of any paths and he gives you <a href="#Adrenaline">Bring the disc to Adrenaline</a>. But first, head for the underground to get Akim's document (see <a href="#Akim">Bring old documents to Akim, pt. 2</a>). Take the document back to Akim and get the next task, <i>Bring old documents to Akim, pt. 3</i>.</p>

<p>From Akim, head back to the Bar. Along the way, check the two large tanks near the Flea Market. If there is a corpse in the eastern tank, climb the ladder on the west side and enter the tank using the opening. This is the scientist mentioned in the previous dead scientist's note. This one has the <i>Scientist's Notepad</i> with an entry about parts to a door code. See <a href="#ATP">ATP</a>, <a href="#Radar">Radar</a>, and <a href="#"></a> for locations of the code.</p>

<p>Back to the Bar and talk with Garik about Petrenko's thermoses. Next, talk to Lanky about <a href="Petrenko">Petrenko's flask</a>. Lanky asks for five Wrenched artifacts, 50,000 RUs, and 10 microcircuits (which we'll get later). Now follow the vanilla storyline to save Kruglov and progress to Yantar. Be sure to grab Wolfhound's PDA. He is usually in the small building on the south end of the large tanks near the crashed helicopter. Just before you get to the Yantar transition you get an SOS from a stalker. When you spawn in Yantar, two Bandits are standing over the stalker's body. Take them out and get the <i>Note from a dead stalker</i>. This prompts a message to Barman, who then responds, promising to call the stalker's family.</p>

<div>Sakharov sells a bioradar for 330,000 RUs. That's a high price, but well worth it as it shows enemies before you see them.</div>

<p>Ask Sakharov if he has any work for you and he offers the <i>Find Ghost's PDA</i> task. Then, help Kruglov with the measurements. My strategy for this task is to use a shotgun with slugs or darts, and to go ahead of Kruglov and clear out all the zombies in the area. Kruglov stops at the tunnel under the road and waits for you to join him before taking his first measurements. Next, retrieve Vasiliev's information and proceed to Lab X-16. Once you find Ghost and put the controller down, be sure to <a href="#Sakharov">Find Ghost's PDA</a>. Turn in the suit and PDA to Sakharov and ask about transitions to get the <i>Find the "Elder Glassbeads" artifact for Sakharov</i> task, and then talk to Kruglov to get the <a href="#Kruglov">Bring Ghost's Diary to the Scientist</a> task. Next, take the X-16 documents to Barman. This opens the Rostok to Army Warehouses transition, our next destination. But before you leave, ask Barman about Ghost and he tells you about Ghost looking for his double. But before he gives you any more information, he requires a Simbion artifact. The recipe is in your PDA's Encyclopedia page.</p>

<p>Follow the storyline to Cook (not getting involved with Skull's group), and ask him how his drinking allows him to get anything done. He gives you the <i>Bring the crow eggs to the Cook</i> task that you can complete the next time you visit the Forgotten Forest. Next, talk to Skinflint and get the <i>Clear the bloodsuckers from the village</i> task. Then, talk to Lukash about Skull's group. When you complete the task, head for the village to kill Bloodsuckers and get <a href="#Voronin">Voronin's RG-6</a>. It's a good idea to take the weapon back to Voronin before returning to the Freedom base to collect rewards. If the condition of the RG-6 is too bad he will reject it. See <a href="#Voronin">Take the RG-6 from the Freedom base</a> on what to do if that happens. Ask Voronin if there are any other tasks and he gives you the <i>Find the documents</i> task. Ask about Fang to get the <i>Bring the camouflaged exoskeleton</i> task. This gives use three tasks to complete in ATP: Voronin's exo, Adrenaline's disc, and finding one part of the door code.</p>

<p>Before you leave Voronin, take a good hard look at the Boar's head on the wall, focusing on the mouth. In it is the <i>Commander's Note</i>. This is what the <a href="#X18">Military Note</a> was referring to, i.e., the note in the broken mirror.</p>

<p>The Rostok to ATP transition is just west of the Rostok to Army Warehouses transition. See <a href="#Adrenaline">Bring the disc to Adrenaline</a> for what to do next. Afterward, go northwest toward the spot where the road ends at a pond. From there, go north to find the group of stalkers and talk to Kalinin to get the <i>Kill Shnyra</i> task, which spawns an attack by the Bandits. You can also ask about transitions. For a Mama's Beads artifact, he tells you about ATP to Garbage at the east end of the road. After repelling the Bandit attack, go on the offensive and attack the base. Generally, the best cover is where the road enters on either side (east or west).</p>

<div>If you're a looter like me, your backpack is probably max'ed out. Attacking the Bandit base from the east offers a lot of cover and Gray likes to land near that location. If you drop a backpack near where the road enters the complex, you may be able to sell most of your loot.</div>

<p>With the base clear, see <a href="#Voronin">Bring the camouflaged exoskeleton</a> for instructions on that task. If you took the <i>Kill Shnyra</i> task, you can go back for your reward and the next Kalinin task, or wait until the next trip to ATP. For the flash drive with the partial door code, follow this procedure:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Locate the building with the Monolith sign and go north.</li>
	<li>Find the tall utility box with the number on the top panel (north side) matching the third entry of the <a hef="#Agro2">Scientist's Notepad</a>, PK10. Only it's in Russian and has a hyphen, so it looks more like nK-10. This flash drive contains the middle three numbers to the door code.</li>
	<li>Jump onto the fence post and move to north as far as possible without falling off.</li>
	<li>Sprint-jump onto the utility box.</li>
	<li>Search the cache and grab the flash drive.</li>
</ol>

<p>With the camouflaged exoskeleton, you can easily complete Sidorovich's <i>Steal the box from the outpost</i>. After that, you can turn it in to Voronin (if you want). You will get your own later in the game. If you have any outstanding tasks with the guys in Darkscape, such as Yurik's Burer hand, Bes' ammo, or Fox's medkits, pack 'em up and head for Cordon by way of Dark Valley and Darkscape. Even though the camouflaged exoskeleton makes you really hard to see, BTRs have no trouble seeing you at a distance. Soldiers can only see you if they are really close. They know you're there, and point their weapons at you, but don't shoot. So, you have to approach from the east using the fallen tree along the east fence and jump over the fence. You don't need to land on the outhouse roof, because inside the outhouse are the microcircuits for Lanky. Now go north to the front door of the barracks and inside to get the case. When you leave, use the guard tower stairs in the southwest corner and jump over the south fence to avoid the BTR guarding the front gate. Turn the case in to Sidorovich, who can't read the documents and sends you to Barman. Go into the Rookie Village and pick up <a href="#Fima">Fima Coal's soap</a>. If you have a Groza, go and see Guide. Otherwise, wait until you get the weapon and instead go back to Dark Valley for Voronin's documents and another trip to X-18. Giving Guide a Groza opens the Cordon to Agroprom transition.</p>

<div>At some point when you pass the house where Guide sits, you get a text message from Sidorovich about paying someone 70,000 RUs. When you talk to the guy, tell him you're suspicious. Otherwise, you find out that he's a con artist and you're out the money.</div>

<p>Go northeast from the transition in Dark Valley to the large boulders. On the east side is an opening leading to a tunnel. Petrenko's pistol is north of the dead stalker. Now on to the factory. If the BTR is still outside the front gate, park you Lada near the south-side fence and use it to jump over. If the Military is still fighting with the Bandits, use the camouflaged exoskeleton to get past them. Go to the second floor and grab Voronin's case on the third machine from the north wall. See <a href="#Akim">Bring old documents to Akim, pt. 3</a> for instructions on getting those documents. If you haven't found Friar and the Military PDA yet, check the bodies by the door (this is usually when and where I find it). To exit the complex, go to the southwest corner and use the brick building's platform to jump on the top of the fence, and then to the ground (to avoid too much damage).</p>
</details>
<!--Sakharov docs-->
<details>
<summary>Sakharov Documents<span class="icon">&or;</span></summary>
<p>Take the Dark Valley to Garbage transition, then to the Cordon transition to give Akim his documents. Tell him you have returned with the documents and he gives you the <a href="#Akim">Bring Old Documents, 4 Suits and a PDA to Akim: Part 4</a> task. Also, ask him about the crow eggs and get the <i>Bring the medicine to Akim</i> task. Since you still have the camouflaged exoskeleton, now's a good time to do it. But save the Forgotten Forest for when you have <a href="Cross">Cross' 15 Artifacts</a>. See <a href="#Cook">Cook</a> for instructions.</p>

<p>Back to the Bar to turn in Petrenko's Gauss pistol, Military Outpost box to Barman, and we can now talk to Kostya again to get the next cache. Petrenko offers the <a href="#Petrenko">Exchange artifact</a> task. As you leave Petrenko, find <a href="#Ivantsov">Captain Ivantsov</a> among the group around the campfire. He gives you the <i>Find the Playboy</i> and <i>Give the RG6 grenade launcher</i>. You can also turn in the camouflaged exoskeleton suit and documents to Voronin. Whether you turn the suit in or keep it for a while, Voronin offers you the <a href="#Voronin">Get the sniper rifle from the Mercs</a> and <i>Exchange artifact</i> tasks.</p>

<p>Now to Agroprom to give Adrenaline his disc and pick up Sakharov's documents, which are in the trailer in the middle of the swamp. You can stand near the top of the western hill and kill the swamp things (they don't come up the hill). Take the documents to Sakharov to open the Yantar to Agroprom transition. Ask him, "What's next, professor?" to get the <a href="#Sakharov">Collect scientific books</a> task. Then, say, "Hello" to Kruglov to get the <a href="#Kruglov">Return the missing decoder</a> task.</p>

<div>When you give Adrenaline the disc, you get a task, <a href="#Zahar">Speak to Zahar</a>, who is in Rostok.</div>

<p>Head back to X-16 and start with Akim's document, then Sakharov's, and Kruglov's detector. Exit the lab and head back to the bunker. Give Kruglov the decoder and ask if there is any more work. He gives you the <i>Bring the artifact to Sid</i> task, which you can do on your next trip to Cordon. Return to the Bar and give Petrenko is pistol and the Military documents to Barman. Then find Kostya and ask him if there is any progress on the PDAs. It is only now that Kostya will speak to us (I haven't figured out exactly what triggers it, or if it's a time span, etc.). He gives you the <a href="#Kostya">Find the cache in Laboratory X-18</a> task.</p>

<p>In X-18, the order in which you find Kostya's cache and Sakharov's document depends on the location of Kostya's hint.</p>
</details>
<!--Back to the Bar-->

<summary>Back to the Bar<span class="icon">&or;</span></summary>
<p>Take the X-18 PDA back to Kostya and he gives you the next cache, <a href="#Kostya">Find the cache in the Agroprom</a>. Drop off the suits to Petrenko. You may be tempted to keep one of the suits for the Akim task. But Petrenko won't take just one. Hopefully, you have acquired a Groza and have spoken to Guide about meeting Doc and can do that while in Agroprom. If not, there are other task options:</p>
<ul>
	<li>If you have <a href="#Cross">Cross' artifacts</a>, now might be a good time to complete that and <a href="#Cook">Cook's eggs</a>.</li>
	<li>If you have the items for <a href="#Fima">Fima Coal</a>, you can complete the <i>Box and Safe</i> task.</li>
</ul>
<p>Otherwise, head back to the Bar and report to Kostya. The next cache is in Yantar. Along the way we can speak to James about <a href="#Freeman">Freeman's case</a> and give Kruglov the money from the <a href="#Kruglov">Bring the artifact to Sid</a> task. But first, there is someone else you need to talk to at the Bar.</p>

<summary>Ghost and Fang<span class="icon">&or;</span></summary>
<p>Picking up where you turn in the camouflaged exoskeleton to Voronin and he tells you to speak with the informant (Snitch) at the Bar, Snitch gives the <i>Bring Tyrant's PDA to the informant</i> task in the Swamp. If you have the Simbion artifact, give it to Barman to learn about Ghost wanting a look-alike. Barman sends you to speak with the scientists in Yantar. Go to Yantar and ask Kruglov if he made any progress on the diary. He gives you the <a href="#Kruglov">Get the computer for the scientist</a> task. However, Arhara is not available until we do some work in the Swamp, even though he shows on your map. If you go there, you won't find him.</p>

<p>At this point in the game you probably only have one transition to the Swamp, which is from Cordon. This is convenient since this transition is nearest the target. Also, vodka, cigarettes, and mushrooms are trading commodities for optional tasks in the Swamp. If you've been stashing them, this is a good time to put them in your backpack. You can trade red bloodsucker tentacles for an IMI UZI with Sviblov, too.</p>

<div>You may have one or more tasks requiring items that you may have not found in your travels. It's a good idea to keep an eye on your PDA task list and refer to the <a href="#character">Tasks by Character</a> section when you have the required items. Mostly, these are stand-alone tasks, meaning you can do them at any time without impacting your progress.</div>
</details>
<!--Rat-->
<details id="Rat">
<summary>Rat<span class="icon">&or;</span></summary>
<p>Borov's note mentions a character named Rat who made off with Borov's PDA, and is hiding in the Swamp. There is a possible bug here; if you go to the Clear Sky base before contacting Rat, he might get killed. This happened to me. So, I'm putting this series of tasks at the very start of entering the Swamp.</p>

<p>In Swamp, find Krysyk "Rat" camped directly south of the Agroprom transition. Talk to him to get the <i>Fulfill the request of Krysyk</i> task. This sends you back to the Bar to ask Barman if Rat can hide there. Barman wants Rat's cache, so you have to go back to the Swamp and give Rat Barman's terms. He agrees and gives you the coordinates of his stash, which is in Dark Valley, in the swamp west of the Bandit base. Get the artifacts from the cache and take them to Barman. Then, go back to Rat and get the location of Borov's PDA. Rat starts the long walk to the Bar. Don't be surprise if you encounter him on the road somewhere in between.</p>
</details>
<!--Clear Sky-->
<details id="ClearSky">
<summary>Clear Sky<span class="icon">&or;</span></summary>
<p>The Swamp/Cordon transition is near a group from Clear Sky. Talk to Dyak, the leader of the group, and agree to lead his men in an attack on the Bandits. This is the <i>Free the "Clear Sky" member from captivity</i> task. Remember to get the PDA before a Clear Sky member loots the dead Tyrant. Clear the church, talk to the captive Clear Sky member, and report back to Dyak. Go south past the Fishing Hamlet and, if you like, take on some optional tasks from Cold and Vasily. But, you must take the first two of Sviblov's tasks. Refer to the <a href="#character">Tasks by Character</a> section for instructions.</p>

<p>During Sviblov's second task, <i>Obtain a rifle for Sviblov</i>, you meet Dan, who gives you the task that unlocks the Agroprom to Swamp transition and spawns Arhara. Go north from the Machine Yard and follow the fence west to the Agroprom transition. Meet Arhara and attack the institute building from the south through the hole in the fence, and then through a window. Go up to the third floor and find the dead scientist. Grab the parcel, head back to the Swamp, and give the parcel to Dan. Dan tells you to go back to <a href="#Arhara">Arhara</a>, but finish up here in the Swamp first. Instead, go meet <a href="#Cat">Cat</a>, whose location is marked on your map. After completing the <i>Search the corpse of a Monolith and find a map for Cat</i> task, Cat goes to the Clear Sky base. Go with him and collect your reward from Cold. Sviblov has one more optional task for you if you like. Complete the <i>Find the remaining Monoliths, Cat needs their personal notebooks</i> task and head back to Agroprom.</p>

<p>See Arhara for a simple task in the Agroprom Underground and grab the cache from Rat with Borov's PDA. Give the notebook to Arhara, ask for the next task, and head to X-18. In X-18, grab a computer out of the control room where you found the documents for Barman on your first trip. Next, find the caches in Borov's PDA:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Use the drain pipe on the west to enter the base compound and go straight (east), watching the platform above for Bandits.</li>
	<li>Follow the basin around to the right and use the pipes to jump up to the ledge along the western side.</li>
	<li>Follow the ledge south, then east, and then north to the code-locked door.</li>
	<li>Enter the access code from the PDA and start breaking boxes.</li>
	<li>Stand on the stacked firewood to find the backpack hidden in the overhead duct.</li>
	<li>Open the gate and break a few more boxes.</li>
	<li>When you are done collecting loot, exit the same way you came in and go to the Fuel Station.</li>
	<li>Search the pump with the same characters as in the PDA.</li>
</ol>
<p>Now take the X-18 computer to Kruglov, who is able to decipher "Yakut... at... Warehouses". This does not on your list of tasks.</p>
</details>
<!--LaHavre-->
<details>
<summary>Meet La Havre<span class="icon">&or;</span></summary>
<p>You should have a fairly long list of tasks in the Army Warehouses at this point:</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>Destroy the bloodsuckers in the village</b> - Report back to Skinflint that the job is done.</li>
	<li><b>Kill all of the Duty members at the farm</b> - Likewise, you (probably) need to report back to Lukash that the job is done.</li>
	<li><b>Bring the crow eggs to the Cook</b> - And again, just report to Cook.</li>
	<li><b>Get the sniper rifle from the Mercs</b> - You get the rifle as part of another task yet to come.</li>
	<li><b>Give the RG6 grenade launcher</b> - Stop me if you've heard this, but give it to Skinflint.</li>
	<li><b>Find the cache in the Army Warehouses</b> - See <a href="#Kostya">Kostya</a> for information.</li>
</ul>
<p>You may also have <a href="#Zahar">Speak to Zahar</a>, which you can do on your way from Yantar to Army Warehouses. Or, wait until you talk to Wolf and do both tasks at once. If you completed the <a href="#Kruglov">Get the computer for the scientist</a>, you need to speak with Yakut (he won't talk to you complete the <a href="#LaHavre">Bring the documents from X-10 to Le Havre</a> and speak with Freeman). If your task list differs, you can always reference the <a href="#character">Tasks by Character</a> section. There's is going to be some back-and-forth between the Bar and Army Warehouses. So, this is the time that I like to move my cache to the trailer next to Wolf. Eventually, I'll move it to Radar as that becomes the center of activity later on.</p>

<p>In Army Warehouses, finish up all your tasks and ask Lukash for more work to get the <i>Follow the informant</i> task. This will help you with Voronin's <i>Get the sniper rifle from the Mercs</i> task and you can collect Voronin's <a href="#Voronin">small thermoses</a>. You can also talk to <a href="#Max">Max</a> about a flash drive he wants. Then go to the southern barracks building along the tracks to meet La Havre and take the first two items on his <a href="#LaHavre">list of tasks</a>.</p> 

<p>On the hill east of the village, find Wolf and ask why he's in Army Warehouses to get the <a href="#Wolf">Find and bring the military radio to Wolf</a> task. This is also where you find Kostya (relocated from Rostok) and Yakut. But all Yakut can talk about is the Brain Scorcher, so you have to come back to him later.</p>
</details>
<!--Radar-->
<details id="Radar">
<summary>Radar<span class="icon">&or;</span></summary>
<p>Complete the first part of <a href="#Lukash">Protect the barrier</a> and move on to Radar. You need to return to Army Warehouses so don't waste your time with reporting back to Lukash just yet. As you fight your way up the road to X-10, keep in mind the location of <a href="#Kostya">Kostya's Radar cache</a>. For all but the train location, you may want to report back to Kostya with the PDA and save yourself a trip to the Monolith-occupied complex. Also, take a little side trip (north) up the road on the east side of the map. Check the bed of the truck to see if there is a document that opens the Radar to Dark Valley transition.</p>

<p>For <a href="#Arhara">Arhara's laptop</a>, I recommend approaching the helicopter from the north as there are less mutants. Outside the complex wall, find the dead scientist and trailer. Inside the trailer is a document that opens the Yantar to Radar transition.</p>

<p>In X-10, Monolith is there to greet you. You should have the following tasks in X-10:</p>
<ul>
	<li><a href="#Agro2">Flash drive with part of door code</a> - In the room with platforms on the east and west side, a tank on each platform with three pipes along the floor pointing toward the center of the room. The western platform has a small electrical box on the south side. Search the front left edge of the box to find the flash drive with the first two numbers of the door code.</li>
	<li><a href="#Sakharov">Collect scientific books</a></li>
	<li><a href="#LaHavre">Bring the documents from X-10 to Le Havre</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Turn the Brain Scorcher off. After the blackout, exit the lab and be sure to use the hole at the east end of the wall to trigger Sidorovich's message about meeting the Loners in Pripyat (otherwise, you may set up a bug). At this point, you can either follow the vanilla storyline and continue on to Pripyat, or complete the following tasks:</p>
<ul>
	<li><a href="#Sakharov">Collect scientific books</a> -  Use the Radar to Yantar transition in the northwest corner of the map to give Sakharov his documents.</li>
	<li><a href="#Arhara">Bring the laptop to Arhara's brother</a> - Return to Army Warehouses and give Yakut the laptop.</li>
	<li><a href="#Kostya">Find the cache in the Radar</a> - Return to Army Warehouses and give Kostya the PDA. He tells you the numbers from the PDAs in random order and gives you the <i>Find and inspect the room behind the secret door in laboratory X-10</i> task.</li>
	<li><a href="#LaHavre">Bring the documents from X-10 to Le Havre</a></li>
</ul>
<p>I prefer to complete the storyline to get it out of the way, and to earn the cache that Lukash gives you for the Controller brains; a camouflaged exoskeleton suit of your very own.</p>

<!--Pripyat-->
<details id="Pripyat">
<summary>Pripyat<span class="icon">&or;</span></summary>
<p>Meet the Loners in Pripyat and get to the hotel. In the hotel, get the decoder and turn left (north) out of the room and down to the end of the hall. The last room on the right contains <a href="#Voronin">Voronin's large thermoses</a>. Before you leave the hotel, be sure to take out as many Monolith as you can from the safety of the hotel. Especially the RPGer west of the Ferris Wheel as he overlooks a spawn point and can make it difficult when you need that spot clear for landing. Also, if you have a backpack full of loot to sell, the hotel is a good place to drop a cache backpack. A trader will be setting up shop nearby in the very near future.</p>
</details>
<!--Monolith Control-->
<details>
<summary>Monolith Control<span class="icon">&or;</span></summary>
<p>This is very much the same as the vanilla SoC with one exception: the door to the hologram is locked. Go to the northeast corner of the room with the locked door and turn around to find a brown stash box containing the code for the door. Move around the equipment to the south and locate the keypad.</p>
</details>
<!--CNPP2-->
<details>
<summary>CNPP2<span class="icon">&or;</span></summary>
<p>When you first step out of the doorway, take a look around for chimeras. Also, there's a sniper to the right. Go north around the wall and west to the break in the wall to trigger the three Monoliths. Before moving to the rooftops, continue north to the road and then east to find <a href="#Lukash">Lukash's Controller brains</a>. If you had the Associate Professor enhance your PDA for Controllers, you shouldn't have too much trouble finding them. Just watch out for snipers. Also, grab any <a href="#Ghost">Gold Chunk artifacts</a> that you'll need for later. About the time you get to the road going east and west, you get an SMS from Voronin. You can't do much about it until you complete the CNPP2 map. Once you have the Controller brains and Gold Chunks, go back to the one of the portals near the Monolith Control Center exit.</p>

<p>When you finish the CNPP2 gauntlet, you are teleported back to the Pripyat Ferris Wheel. Take La Havre the document and Lukash his Controller brains. Ask Lukash for the next task (See <a href="#Lukash">Lukash</a> for instructions). See Kostya and get the <a href="#Kostya">Find and inspect the room behind the secret door in laboratory X-10</a> task. You still can't speak to Yakut about Ghost, but you can give him the laptop. Then, go see Freeman, take Voronin his thermoses, and he gives you the <a href="#Voronin">Help the Dutiers in Eastern Pripyat</a> task. You can also ask for his help to get the <i>FInd the computer and the video transmitter</i> task.</p>

Click the link to see Voronin's task instructions.</p>

<p>To meet Bland, you must clear the X-18 complex of Bandits and Mercs. I find it easiest to use the Lada to jump over the wall near the back and work my way to the front. When the last one falls, you get an SMS from Bland telling you he will meet and three neutral characters appear on your minimap. Go into the back building and talk to Bland. Give him the 50,000 RUs and take the flash drive to Freeman. The information on the flash drive implicates La Harve, but no task is listed in your PDA. When you confront La Harve, be sure to stash everything or you will lose it. When you wake, there is a PDA on the floor nearby. Pick it up to see that you need to take the PDA to the Assistant Professor at the Bar. You/Strelok also have a thought to talk with Yakut.</p>
	
<p>Yakut tells you about La Havre's group heading to the northwest checkpoint. The leader of the group (not La Havre) is marked on your map. Kill him and get the metal box he's carrying. Take that to Yakut and ask him about Ghost. He sends you back to the Agroprom Underground. Along the way, stop at the Bar and give Bolt's PDA to the Assistant Professor. If you have a Kolobok artifact, take it with you.</p>
	
<p>The Assistant Professor agrees to check the PDA, but wants a Kolobok artifact in return and promises to send you an SMS when the PDA is ready. This takes about 45 game-time minutes and you can either wait or come back later. You may notice that the speaking with the Assistant Professor and the artifact are two separate tasks in your PDA. You can get the PDA information without the artifact, but you still have it as an incomplete task. The information you get is, at the moment, of little use.</li>
	
<p>In the Agroprom Underground, as you near the ventilation shaft going to Strelok's hideout, you get a message from an unknown sender and the <i>Find Ghost</i> task. The message tells you to go to the Radar forest.</p>
</details>
<!--FindGhost-->
<details>
<summary>Find Ghost<span class="icon">&or;</span></summary>
<p>From Agroprom, go Garbage > Dark Valley to get to Radar. In Radar, continue west through the hole in the fence and along the north side of the boulders. Follow the boulders around to find Ghost's camp on the south side. Talk to Ghost and get the <a href="#Ghost">Kill Tusk and get his flashdrive</a> task. This task takes you to the northeast corner of the Swamp. Hopefully, you have a Night Star artifact and the dried bear paw for <a href="#Kalmyk">Kalmyk</a> to make <a href="#Cat">Cat's medicine</a>. Drop the items off to Kalmyk and meet up with Owl.</p>

<p>With Tusk's group eliminated and Cat's medicine ready, return to the Bar. Cat has more information on Monolith and gives you the <i>Get information of the Monolith in the Agroprom for Cat</i> task. Now give Ghost the flash drive and he gives you the <i>Kill Tusk. Part 2. Bring the documents to Ghost</i> task in Cordon. For this task, I recommend bringing an RPG. From Radar, go to Yantar and drop off Sakharov's three books, then to Agroprom. Again, see the respective <i>Tasks by Character</i> entries for task instructions.</p>

<div>You may encounter a bug here where the freed Loners pick up weapons from the fallen Monolith and attack the Military in the institute complex. There doesn't seem to be any other option than to kill everything in the area so that you can talk to the Loners. If that happens, you can grab <a href="#Lukash">Lukash's dynamite</a> on the second floor.</div>

<p>When you talk to the Loners, they ask you to guide them to the factory complex. Once they are safe, talk to them again to find out more, then move on to the Cordon and the Rookie Village. Complete the Tusk task and return to the Bar. Talk to Cat, who sends you to Skinflint on the Freedom base to find Rabinovich. If you have Lukash's dynamite, you can drop it off.</p>
</details>
<!--FindRabinovich-->
<details>
<summary>Find Rabinovich<span class="icon">&or;</span></summary>
<p>Get the <a href="#Skinflint">Get the ammo box from Sidorovich</a> task from Skinflint. Ask Skinflint if there is anything exciting happening lately, and then ask him for help finding the trader Rabi. Skinflint sends you to the Bloodsucker Village (there's no update on your task list). Go to the farmstead on the southeast edge of the village and talk to Joker. Now go to the northwest edge to find a wounded Modest. Give him a medkit and he tells you he saw Rabi on the road to Pripyat. This spawns an ambush by Mercs to the north and east. Fight them off and head for Pripyat. </p>

<p>Stop by and give Ghost the Tusk document, then continue on to Pripyat. In Pripyat, go through the underground car park and north up the road on the east side of the hotel. There's heavy fighting between Monolith and everyone else, plus Duty and Freedom may go at it, too. Don't get too distracted by it until you meet with Rabinovich. Just before you get to the Ferris Wheel, you can see a neutral stalker in the building on the east side. Use the rubble to climb up and into the open window. In the next room is Rabinovich. Talk to him until he gives you the information you're after, then he collapses. Eventually, he becomes hostile and you have to put him down. You get a task update to return to Cat, and a new task <a href="#Cat">Find the Black Doctor</a>.</p>

<div>Hopefully, you encounter a Monolith named Charon. Put him down and loot his corpse to get the <a href="#Charon">CacheCharon</a> task.</div>

<p>Now for the fighting in the streets: Make your way west to the north side of Monolith Headquarters, i.e., the Palace of Culture. Enter from the north, turn right and then left. Take the stairs on the other side of the room. Go either way where the stairs turn and find Doc's book. Then go back upstairs to the large room with six Monolith in a trance. Take them out and notice on your minimap that two friendlies move in from the west. This is <a href="#Doc">Doc</a> (with his pseudodog) and <a href="#Syak">Syak</a>, a trader. Talk to Doc and give him his book. He gives you the <i>Find the Doctor's Medallion</i> task. Talk to Syak to get the <i>Bring the toolbox to Sid</i> task. Go back to the Bar and report to Cat. He sends you to Zahar, who gives you the <a href="#Zahar">Find Brother Louis in the Swamps</a> task. Go Garbage > Agroprom > Swamp. Complete the first part of <i>Find Brother Louis in the Swamps</i> and use the nearby transition to Cordon.</p>

<p>Talk to Sidorovich:</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>Hey Sid, looks like you've had another hard day of sitting there drinking booze all day long.</b> - This gets you the ammo for Skinflint.</li>
	<li><b>Hey, Sid, you look like shit! You need to lay off the vodka for awhile.</b> - This gets you the Metal box for Syak.</li>
</ul>

<p>Be sure to have a Goldfish artifact with you and deliver Skinflint's ammo and get the <i>Bring the information to Skinflint from the Deserter</i> task. If you don't have a Taurus Raging Bull yet, buy one from Skinflint. Next, drop off Syak's toolbox. Get the <i>Bring the Goldfish artifact</i> and then the <i>Bring the Briefcase in X-18</i> tasks. Then, move on to <i>Help the Dutiers in Eastern Pripyat</i>.</p>
</details>
<!--EasternPripyat-->
<details>
<summary>Eastern Pripyat<span class="icon">&or;</span></summary>
<p>For this trip, I recommend a sniper rifle, short-range weapon for clearing a building, and the auto-firing Gauss you got from Ghost (save your ammo for the underground). Also, put as many of the following items in your backpack as you have:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Desert Eagle</li>
	<li>Taurus Raging Bull</li>
	<li>Goldfish artifact</li>
	<li>TOZ-32</li>
	<li>Uzi</li>
	<li>Two Ravens Eye</li>
	<li>AEK-971</li>
</ul>

<p>You spawn in Eastern Pripyat near Plichko's group. Stash all but your sniper and assault rifles, then go talk to Plichko. Only talk to him about the Sports Complex, do not talk or ask about anything else or you set up a bug that prevents you from completing the task. See <a href="#Voronin">Help the Dutiers in Eastern Pripyat</a> for instructions.</p>

<p>With the Sports Complex under Duty control, head northeast around the school to the Vine Anomaly. Matvei Kulinar is trapped by some Chimeras. If you have a Gauss gun, you can take out the Chimeras with ease. Matvei is up on the top floor of the north building. Approach the vine from the west, turn left and left again. When you get to the place where you can cross to another vine, turn right and continue up to Matvei's location. Ask him how you can help and he gives you the <a href="#Matvei">Help Matvei Kulinar</a> task.</p>

<p>Complete the task and, as you leave the laundry mat, you meet someone coming the other way. This is Hector, Matvei's partner and repair technician. Then you get a message from Sakharov about some missing scientists and get the <a href="#Sakharov">Find the scientist in Jupiter</a> task. This opens transitions between Eastern Pripyat, Jupiter Underground, and Jupiter. Jupiter Underground is full of mutant spiders. This is why I suggested you bring the Gauss. Grab your stashed items and fill as many of Matvei's orders as you can. Use the stash box on the first floor (southeast corner) for incomplete orders and move on to Jupiter.</p>
</details>
<!--Jupiter-->
<details>
<summary>Jupiter<span class="icon">&or;</span></summary>
<p>Check your map for the Jupiter Underground entrance, which is south of the laundry mat. Use a knife or crowbar to hit the door open. If that doesn't work, go to the other side and shoot the door from the back. Climb down the ladder, turn around and go south toward the door that appears to be blocked. You spawn to the underground, and now the door is west of the ladder (and when you return you must climb two ladders). Anyway, find the dead stalker and read his PDA. Then move on to encounter some snorks. When you get to the large room, it is filled with mutant spiders. Sprint to the ladder on the left (northwest) and up to the platform. From here you can safely snipe some of the spiders with the Gauss. But be conservative with your ammo as there are more spiders to come. Search the giant spiders for a Spider's Paw, which you will need later on. The smaller spiders can kill from a few feet away, even if you're not high enough off the ground. When the large room is clear, there is a bonus cache that probably belonged to the dead stalker:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Go to the north end and find the cement slabs stacked up next to a large tank. Use the slabs to get on top of the tank.</li>
	<li>Go up the two small pipes and jump over the fence.</li>
	<li>Go up the ladder to the top without going over the rail.</li>
	<li>Go to the southwest edge of the platform and jump to the pipe to get to the next platform.</li>
	<li>Continue on around using the ledge to get to the next platform.</li>
	<li>Up the next ladder.</li>
	<li>Turn east and go across the two pipes.</li>
	<li>Use the electrical box to jump on the two pipes going down to the top of the overhead crane.</li>
	<li>Go to the motor section and cross (south).</li>
	<li>Turn east and up the two pipes.</li>
	<li>And again to the next platform.</li>
	<li>Continue on to find the room blocked by debris.</li>
	<li>In the cabinet with the microscope on top, look inside through the narrow opening to find the backpack with the loot.</li>
</ol>

<p>Continue on through the underground and stay on top of vehicles and boxes as much as possible to avoid the small spiders. The underground passage ends at the large freight elevator, which is the transition to Jupiter.</p>

<p>In Jupiter, make your way out of the factory while watching for Mercs. As you continue through the administration building, you get an SMS from a wounded stalker and his location is marked on your map. Take the east road north to the stalker (Dimon Kalter), give him a medkit, and ask him what he is doing. He gives you the <i>Help the stalker</i> task. Follow Dimon around the north side of the quarry. When you get to the work camp, a pack of pseudodogs attack. You best option is, as you near the camp, stay below (south of) the top ridge (out of sight of the pseudodogs), sprint ahead, jump up on the truck and into the back. Keep moving around so the pseudodogs can't jump at you. With the way clear, take out your sniper rifle and continue following the stalker.</p>

<div>When you attack the train station, do not use explosives. This turns the scientists and trader against you.</div>

<p>Once the Bandits are eliminated, talk to Professor Plotnikov and agree to lead them to the mobile lab. Then go back to Dimon and report that there is a spy. This prompts the scientists to move out of the basement and out the south door (notice the working Lada). When you get them to the lab, talk to Plotnikov again and he tells you of a cache. You can also do some work for him. See <a href="#Plotnikov">Plotnikov</a> for a list of jobs and instructions, as well as how to get back to the underground. To locate the Bandit cache:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Go to the Oasis. The puzzle-maze has been disabled.</li>
	<li>Find the dead Loner and read his PDA. This solves the mystery of the spy, and you/Strelok send an SMS to Dimon.</li>
	<li>Go back to the puzzle-maze room and to the southeast corner.</li>
	<li>Turn north and jump up to the beam, and then to the air duct.</li>
	<li>Turn left (west) and follow the duct, low-crouching when necessary.</li>
	<li>Continue following the duct as it first turns right, and then turns left.</li>
	<li>The backpack is just past the left turn.</li>
</ol>
<p>Plotnikov's first task, <i>Find the three scientific suits</i>, takes you to X-18. You can grab Syak's briefcase, too. Go to X-18, get the suits and briefcase. Then, go to Radar > Pripyat to drop off the briefcase and get the next task, <a href="#Syak">Bring the new armor</a>. On to Jupiter to give Plotnikov the suits. Continue doing Plotnikov's tasks until you get <I>Find in X-8 briefcase with dosimeters</i>. Now you have a bypass for the underground and you can return to Radar by going directly to Eastern Pripyat > Pripyat > Radar.</p>
</details>
<!--X8-->
<details>
<summary>X-8<span class="icon">&or;</span></summary>
<p>In Radar, go to the code-locked door accessed from the elevated platform at the end of the road to Pripyat. On your PDA, go to Diary > Journal > Door Codes to open it. Open the door on the right (west) and go down the steps to get a task update for the <i>Find the X-25 laboratory in the Radar</i>. Find and search the one corpse in a different uniform to find the prototype and get another update to see Kostya. Go on to Lab X-8, which is guarded by a Merc squad. Hop into the truck bed for cover and snipe them as they approach. When the way is clear, use the information from the <a href="#ATP">ATP</a> and <a href="#LeHavre">X-10</a> flash drives, along with the <i>Bolt's PDA</i> information to open the lab door. Clear the lab of Le Havre's men and grab Plotnikov's dosimeters. If you've completed the <a href="#Matvei">Find the TOZ-34 and the Uzi</a> task, locate the X-8 cache before you leave the lab. Return to Jupiter and take a look at your PDA's Diary Journal page for <i>Information from Le Havre's Map</i> to see the locations of two caches there. You can empty these caches as you finish <a href="#Plotnikov">Plotnikov's tasks</a>. Next, go to the Eastern Pripyat bookstore and get that Le Havre cache. Now back to Army Warehouses to report finding the URT prototype.</p>
</details>
<!--URT-->
<details id="URT">
<summary>URT<span class="icon">&or;</span></summary>
<p>Your conversation with Kostya results in two more tasks, <i>Speak with Sakharov</i> and <a href="#Kostya">Find the cache in Pripyat</a>. Go to Sakharov and he gives you the <a href="#Sakharov">Find Vasiliev's PDA</a> task in X-16. While you're in X-16 you can search for <a href="#Matvei">Matvei's tunnel cache</a>. Return to Sakharov and give him the PDA. You should also have the key from <a href="#Cross">Bring the teleporter to Cross</a>. In turn, he returns the fully functional <i>Handheld Teleportator</i> (URT). Here's how it works:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Select a map from the left navigation. This loads the main window with locations within the selected map.</li>
	<li>Select a location.</li>
	<li>Select either a Battery or Moonlight artifact. Note that the artifact is destroyed.</li>
	<li>Click Enter. It may lag a bit, but you see a white light and then the map loads with an autosave.</li>
</ul>
<p>You do not get any locations when selecting a map that you don't have access to yet. Try transporting to Pripyat to look for Kostya's caches. When you give Kostya the PDA from Pripyat, he doesn't give you another task right away. Now you can look for <a href="#Doc">Doc's medallion</a>. If you have collected enough Anomolous Bisons for Cross, bring those along with you either before or after you get Doc's medallion.</p> 
</details>
<!--Owl-->
<details>
<summary>Owl's Note<span class="icon">&or;</span></summary>
<p>In the <a href="#Ghost">Kill Tusk and get his flashdrive</a> task, Owl (one of Ghost's men) was killed and his flash drive contained information about a cache in X-10. Go through the lab until you get to the last room before the Brain Scorcher. In the northeast corner, jump on the ventilation equipment to find the backpack on top. Taking the note out of the backpack spawns a host of mutants, i.e., Controllers, Burers, and more Bloodsuckers. Once you're out of the lab, take the note to Ghost, and he gives you the <a href="#Ghost">Find the Engineering Plan</a> task. Ghost sends you to <a href="#Freeman">Freeman</a>, who sends you to Darkscape to find Tamaz and get some drawings.</p>

<p>Tamaz is located in the village west of the Stalkers. Because of the underbrush, you have to get in close. I suggest starting from the southeast corner of the complex. It doesn't take long for Tamaz's men to come at you. Go for headshots to conserve ammo and avoid getting caught reloading. When it's clear, find Tamaz and get the <i>Detailed plan of the Radar bunker</i> document. Take the document back to Freeman, who discovers a transition from the Brain Scorcher room to the Sarcophagus.</p>
</details>
<!--UnexploredLand-->
<details id="UL">
<summary>Unexplored Land<span class="icon">&or;</span></summary>
<div>A few notes about this map: The map is full of Avengers. They like to sit along the paths ready to ambush. They also have the paths mined, so stay a few feet next to paths instead of traveling on them. You need to have your Firefighter Outfit from the Labyrinth to use the Fire Cave's Lower Entrance (this comes later on, so you don't need it right away).</div>

<p>When you spawn in Unexplored Land you are greeted by Astrologer. Finish the conversation and go north to find Hermit's camp. Hermit sends you to find a box of ammo that fell out of a helicopter. Go talk to one of the other Loners to get more information. Then follow the path north to the swamp. Along the way, look for <a href="#LeHavre">Le Havre's cache</a>. The path turns east and runs north of the swamp. Find the boulder along the north edge and go directly south to find the box along the south edge of the pool. Return with the box to complete the <i>Find out about the box</i> task. Then, go north of the camp to find the Old Man. Talk to him and then go into the cave and find the Gynecologist. He gives you the <a href="#Gynecologist">Learn about the medicines</a> task. Since he doesn't want you to kill anyone, you need a Camouflaged Exoskeleton.</p>

<p>Use the URT to teleport to the Sarcophagus Wish Granter area, or use the X-10 teleport (which puts you on the opposite side of the area). While you are there, you can look for <a href="#Charon">Charon's cache</a>. You spawn in the northwest corner of the room, safe from Monolith for the moment. Remember this spot as there is a transition to open nearby later on. Lukash's cache is up near the roof and two of Charon's possible locations are on the way. The Camouflaged Exoskeleton suit has a weight limit of 100 kg, so you may want to stash anything you don't need for now so you can put the suit on as soon as you get it.</p>
<ol>
	<li>Go south to the campfire and up the ramp.</li>
	<li>Go west to the top of the wall overlooking Wish Granter. Be aware that you are now visible to Monolith below.</li>
	<li>Turn north and jump up to each level until you are directly east of the large pillar (directly east of Wish Granter).</li>
	<li>Drop down on the east side to the ledge and go north to find a backpack in the corner. This is the first possible Charon cache location. If it's not there, go back to where you dropped down.</li>
	<li>Going west this time, either jump down to the ledge or low-crouch under the broken cement and drop down to the metal truss.</li>
	<li>Follow the ledge to the north side until you reach a ladder going up. If there is no backpack, continue on. This is the second possible Charon cache location.</li>
	<li>Climb the ladder and look south to see the truss going north and south.</li>
	<li>Make your way to the west side of the truss and move along to the south end. You may need to take out some Monolith to reduce the fire coming at you. But be aware that more are coming.</li>
	<li>At the south end, find the backpack between the south wall and the truss running east and west.</li>
	<li>Put the Camouflaged Exoskeleton on and make your way back down the ladder. Remember that the suit only keeps you invisible for short periods of time. You may need to find a safe spot to take it off and put it back on again.</li>
	<li>Go back to the first truss where there is an opening in the wall that you can use the lower part of the truss to get to.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you did not find Charon's cache, see <a href="#Charon">Charon</a> for the remaining possibilities. If you dropped a backpack at the spawn point, retrieve it and use the URT to get to the Cordon. Now go to Cordon for the medicine. Use the URT to teleport to the west of the southern checkpoint. Go south, watching for mines, and jump over the fence. Go east to the square two-story building on the west side of the road and up the stairs. Collect the medicine and syringes, then go out the way you came in. Your next stop is the northern checkpoint to <a href="#Akim">ask Akim about Miner's flashlights</a>. Complete the <i>Catch a pseudo dog puppy</i> task for Akim to get the flashlights and take them to Miner to complete his tasks.</p>

<p>In Unexplored Land, give Gynecologist the medicine and talk with Jora about the safe. He gives you the <i>Learn about the batteries</i> task. Talk to the Old Man about the Fire Cave and then to Hermit about the location. The easiest way to find the Fire Cave is to go northwest to the western edge of the swamp that Hermit referenced. The entrance that you need is directly west, so you have to backtrack a little. Go about halfway down the mountain and look for a large boulder. The entrance is just to the south. If you have a bioradar, you will see someone there named Pilgrim. Talk to him and get the <i>Find Pilgrim's Cache</i> task. If you have the Camouflaged Exoskeleton suit, this is a simple fetch. You must pass an Avenger camp along the way. Go east along the path that runs south of the swamp to find the quarry. Approach the excavator from the southwest to jump on the tread. Work your way up to the west side of the cabin to find the backpack on the floor. Give Pilgrim the contents and he gives you Old Man's watch. You must come back for the batteries in 90 game-time minutes. Give the Old Man his watch to open transitions to Dark Valley and Army Warehouses.</p>

<p>Once you get the batteries from Pilgrim, give them to Hologram. It may not come right away, but shortly after completing the <i>Learn about the batteries</i> task you get an SMS from Hermit. Go talk to him and get the <i>Learn about the Ultra Detectors</i> task. Talk to Hologram and get the <a href="#Hologram">Learn about the Elite Detectors</a> task. About this time you get an SMS from Adrenaline. Ignore it for now until you complete the Ultra Detectors task. Go to Sakharov to purchase two Elite detectors. He usually has only one, so you have to leave the map and come back for the second one (at 50,000 RUs each). Say to Sakharov, "Professor, I need to talk to you." and get the <a href="#Sakharov">Find the group of scientists in laboratory X-10 and get all the details</a> task. Bring the detectors and a Plasma Caterpillar artifact to Hologram and he sends you to Cyclops for a hint on the cache with the Ultra detectors.</p>

<p>Go back to Garbage and to the east end of the garbage pile south of the Flee Market. Find the backpack on the west side of the big dead tree. Take the detector to Adrenaline at the Agroprom factory and keep one for yourself. When you complete the task you get an SMS from Gynecologist that Cyclops has the safe open. So, back to Unexplored Land. Talk to Gynecologist to get the <i>Learn about the floppy disk</i> task. Talk to Cyclops for another hint, which opens a transition between the Unexplored Land and Labyrinth.</p>

<p>In Labyrinth, take the left of three passages, left at the first circular passage, and then three rights to get back to the small passage guarded by three Burner anomalies. Throw a bolt to activate the anomalies and go into the passage. Just ahead is a wounded Merc with the disc beside him. Take the disc and go back the way you came. Talk to Gynecologist to complete the task and get an SMS from an unknown stalker telling you to make a copy and give it to Astrologer. Then, talk to Cyclops about the flasks needed to make the medicine. See <a href="#Gynecologist">Reagent Flasks</a> for instructions.</p>

<p>When you give Gynecologist the flasks, he tells you that he needs items from the Fire Cave and gives you the <i>Find the power supply and the circuitboards</i> task. He sends you north of the quarry to locate a key that will disable one of the teleports guarding the cave. Return to the eastern swamp and go northeast toward the small boulders on the map. Approach the anomaly field from the northwest toward two boulders together. On the opposite side (southeast) is a human skeleton and the teleport deactivator. Put on the Firefighter suit and take the key to the middle of the eastern swamp. The entrance to the cave is slightly southwest of the pond's center. You can see it if you low-crouch to get under the surface. Make your way through the passage taking care not to fall through the hole and meet up with Pilgrim again. He agrees to help you get the formula from the snipers and to let you search the cave for the other items.</p>

<p>Continue north to explore the cave. Notice that the passage closes behind you and you can no longer get to Pilgrim. At the first fork, go left and find a small room with two circuit boards and another teleport deactivator. Pilgrim doesn't seem to mind if you help yourself to the items in the dynamite box. Continue on south through the passage to find another small room with two power supplies (and again the passage closes behind you). These are all the items you need for Gynecologist. Continue on through the passage and turn left to exit the cave. Go southwest back to Gynecologist and report to complete the task. You get an SMS from Pilgrim that he messaged the Avengers. Go speak to Chimera in the trailer and get the <i>Kill Sidorovich</i> task (and for some strange reason, you also lose the teleport deactivators).</p>

<p>Report back to Gynecologist and get the <i>Learn about solutions</i> task, sending you to Owl (a different one), a veteran Hunter on the mountain between the eastern swamp and Hermit's camp. Gynecologist gives you five Chimera Claws and 30,000 RUs, but Owl is going to want 10 claws and 100,000 RUs. Hopefully, you've been stashing claws. When you talk to Owl he gives you the <i>Learn about the controller corpse</i> task that sends you to Radar. The Controller weighs 70 kgs. so be sure you can take on that much weight. Go to Radar, and to the hole in the fence near X-25. Stay north along the rocks, past the large tree to two large trees together. Find the Controller between the north tree and the rocks. Carry it back to Owl, who says, "Screw this, you're asking too much." but does the job anyway.</p>

<p>Tell Owl you have the payment and he tells you the head is over by the wood pile, which is at the north end of the camp. Take the head to Chimera, but he doesn't give you the formula. He does, however, tell you there's a cache, which is all Cyclops needs and he sends you an SMS. Chimera also offers a reward for finding a missing girl, but no task or information on how to go about finding her. Go back to Cyclops to get a hint on the location of the cache, which is in Radar. Go to the Radar complex and through the south opening on the west side. Use the ladder on the left to go up to the platform, then another short ladder to the next level. Use the broken duct to get to the roof of the L-shaped building along the south wall. Go east to the hole in the roof and use the going northwest to southeast to enter the building. Turn left (south) down the hallway. Find the backpack, doll, and flasks in the first room on the right (again, you can put the flasks in an artifact container). Take the flasks back to Gynecologist and he sends you to Cyclops for one more cache (a backpack on the ground next to the tractor in Bloodsucker Village). Oddly, Gynecologist only takes four of the six flasks. If you search the profuser, you can leave the last two there. You get an SMS from Fang telling you to meet him and Pilgrim at their new base, i.e., the Fire Cave. Put the Firefighter suit on and use the eastern swamp entrance. Again, no task appears on your PDA list.</p>

<summary>Warlab<span class="icon">&or;</span></summary>
<p>Your conversation with Fang opens transitions between Radar and Warlab, which is the same location as X-25. There is also a transition between Warlab and X-16, but you won't be able to access it yet. When you spawn in Warlab, there is a fight between Monolith and Mercenaries. My advice is to wait until the shooting stops, then go in and clear out any survivors. Find the Mercenary with a notebook and take it to Fang, who is now in Army Warehouses. If you're looting the dead and have too much to carry in one load, drop a backpack outside the Warlab and stash it all there, not inside the Warlab. Take all the stuff that Skinflint won't buy, like pistols and suits. Be sure to leave room for your camouflaged exoskeleton, and go meet Fang on the farmstead next to the Freedom Base. Fang sends you to Lukash to get a ring. But first, go to the Bar and sell your loot. Then, jump over to ATP for Charon's <a href="#Charon">Blue flashes</a> cache. Afterward, on to Lukash.</p>

<p>Lukash gives you the <a href="#Lukash">Find the ring</a> task that takes you to the Labyrinth. Now go behind the HQ building and talk to <a href="#Screw">Screw</a> to get his task and go to the Wild Territory. Using the Wild Territory to Labyrinth transition puts you at the top level in Labyrinth. However, Spider is most likely on the second level. Starting from the Cave transition reduces the number of Monolith you have direct contact with. Either way, find Spider and get the ring. This starts an SMS exchange between you and Lukash. The end result is the <i>Meeting in the Warlab</i> task.</p>

<p>When you enter the Warlab, there are a few things to do in preparation for the next task:</p> 

<ol>
	<li>Go to down the stairs to the right (west) of the first guard.</li>
	<li>Go to the southeast corner and break out the wooden planks. Continue on and break the planks covering the ladder down.</li>
	<li>Go back out and across to the stairs going down to the room with the broken out floor.</li>
	<li>Turn left (south) through the doorway and follow the hallway into the room with a large platform.</li>
	<li>Go down the stairs and down the ladder in the southeast corner.</li>
	<li>Follow the passage to the last room on the left.</li>
	<li>Go to the end, going right around the anomaly. This triggers a Bloodsucker to spawn, but you're safe on the far side of the anomaly. If you're lucky, the Bloodsucker will run into the anomaly...problem solved.</li>
	<li>Now go back to the room with the broken out floor, drop down, and meet with Panther</li>
</ol>

<p>Panther gives you the <a href="#Panther">Retrieve the walkie talkie</a> task. Give the walkie talkie to Panther and get the <i>Get the stuffed psuedodog</i> task from Dembel. Panther then gives you the <i>Disk for Panther</i> task, which is a priority. Enter the Radar complex from the south and find the lieutenant in, or near, the building set into the hillside. Take the disc back to Panther, get the <i>Bring the suit</i> task, and go on to Dark Valley (with your camouflaged exoskeleton). You can get Dembel's stuffed pseudodog and Charon's cache, too. Go to Army Warehouses > Unexplored Land > Dark Valley to get to the Bandit base. Get the suit for Panther, then go to Borov's office and grab the stuffed pseudodog on top of the cabinet in the southwest corner. Next, get <a href="#Akim">Akim's PDA</a>, <a href="#Screw">Screw's vise</a>, and on to Charon's <a href="#Charon">Dark Valley cache</a>.</p>

<p>Go back to the Warlab, give Dembel his trophy, and Panther her suit. Another Merc, Dushman, shows up and blocks our way out. No one seems to mind if you take out the Merc guard on the right (shoot through the glass). Otherwise, you'll have a tough time with this next part. Talk to Dushman, but only get close enough to be able to talk (too close and it doesn't go well), staying inside the room with Panther. Click through the conversation quickly (you can read it later) and jump to the left while Panther and her crew clear the lab. When the last Merc is down, talk to Panther and again to Dembel. Now take Lukash's ring back.</p>

<p>When you ask Lukash for your reward, he gives you another task instead, to escort Vitamin's group to the Warlab. At this point you get an SMS from Panther that she's leaving the Warlab. Talk to Vitamin and get the <i>Help Freedom - Lead the group</i> task. Meet Vitamin in Radar at the Army Warehouses transition, and lead the group to the fence opening to Warlab (they stop there). Talk to Vitamin again, and then move on to the Warlab. Inside, help Freedom clear out the pseudodogs. Vitamin turns off the teleport to the secret lab and stands in the same spot as Panther did. Talk to him to receive a Gravity Gun (very useful for getting artifacts out of anomalies). Now you can access the secret lab:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Go south through the doorway and follow the passage left (east) to the next room with a catwalk around three sides.</li>
	<li>Drop down to the next level and go east through the doorway into the far elevator shaft.</li>
	<li>Climb up the ladder to the third level and into the secret lab.</li>
	<li>Find the ecologist, Lazy, in the orange suit and talk to him.</li>
	<li>Make your way up the stairs to the next room and talk to <a href="#Klenov">Klenov</a>, who gives you the <i>Speak with Victor Hologram</i> task. You get a message from Fang and Cyclops, too.</li>
</ol>

<!--UnfinishedBusiness-->
<details>
<summary>Unfinished Business<span class="icon">&or;</span></summary>
<p>The storyline is about to go in a direction involving new maps and characters. This is probably a good time to take care of some open tasks, such as:</p>
<ul>
	<li><a href="#Matvei">Complete the order for weapons</a> - You should be on the fifth order for three shotguns and an Igloment. The next two orders are for items you should have and can put in your backpack to save a trip.</li>
	<li><b>Information for the fourth order</b> - The two caches in Jupiter and Pripyat.</li>
	<li><a href="#Charon">Cacheat the ChNPP-1</a></li>
	<li><a href="#Skinflint">Bring information to Skinflint from the Deserter</a></li>
</ul>
<p>You can:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Get the Pripyat cache from Matvei's fourth order.</li>
	<li>Drop off his last two orders.</li>
	<li>Go on to the Jupiter cache from Matvei's fourth order.</li>
	<li>Go to the Jupiter Underground cache from Matvei's fifth order (use the Jupiter entrance).</li>
	<li>Get the Pripyat cache from Matvei's fifth order.</li>
	<li>Get Charon's ChNPP-1 cache.</li>
	<li>You can choose to go into the Sarcophagus for Matvei's last order cache, or wait and get it with Charon's X-16 cache.</li>
	<li>If you have the artifacts, you can use the URT to find Skinflint's deserter. Be aware that this task offers the <i>Get the commanders orders</i> in Agroprom, so you may want to pack your camouflaged exoskeleton. Also, you can wait to take the briefcase back to Skinflint, that is, don't make a special trip.</li>
</ol>

<p>When you've done all you can do, or care to do, head for Unexplored Land. Talk to Cyclops and get another stash, then to Hologram to get the <a href="#Hologram">Bring Victor Hologram to Klenov</a> task. Lead him to the Army Warehouses transition. Continue on and take Skinflint his briefcase, and then meet Hologram in the Warlab. Bring along 10 Cobblestone artifacts and the <a href="#Miner">Heart of a Poltergeist</a> artifact if you have them. When you finish with Klenov, go to the Bar and meet Fang.</p>
</details>
<!--RedForest-->
<details>
<summary>Red Forest<span class="icon">&or;</span></summary>
<p>Fang and Pilgrim have relocated again to the Bar, more precisely, to the campfire directly west of Petrenko's location. Talk to Fang and get the <a href="#Fang">Find Denis in the Red Forest and rescue him</a> task. When you leave Rostok, go to Yantar and complete the <a href="#Charon">Cachein Laboratory X-16</a> task. The Red Forest transition is along Radar's south cliffs near the east corner. I recommend you pack Ghost's rapid-fire Gauss, or whatever you prefer for dealing with Controllers and Bloodsuckers.</p>

<p>When you spawn in Red Forest you get a message and new task, <i>Help the group of stalkers</i>. Talk to Shadowman and agree to help them clear the Mercs off the bridge to Limansk to complete the task and get the <i>Help stalkers capture the bridge in the Red Forest</i> task. You can either stay with the group or move up the road and take the Mercs on yourself (and collect all the loot). Talk to Shadowman again when the bridge is clear to complete the task. Be sure to check the backpack in the truck bed on the Limansk side of the bridge. As a show of gratitude, Shadowman and his men leave you a small stash box of items in the middle of the road going south. If you have the Charon cache "Near the bridge", grab it now and move on to the mine. </p>

<p>Denis is in the Red Forest Mine, along with a couple Controllers, a Bloodsucker, civilian zombies, and kamikaze rats. You may want to first check on the stalker camp just outside the north gate to be sure there are no Mercs or Monolith. Then, find Denis and escort him through a band of Mercs to the Red Forest north gate. When you get Denis to the camp you send Fang an SMS. Denis couldn't find the documents, so Fang suggests you talk to Forester and gives you the <i>Bring the documents from the Red Forest to Fang</i> task. Complete this task and Fang sends you to the Rookie Village to meet with Astrologer. But first, get Charon's <i>Cachein the Red Forest</i> (if you haven't already) and cross the bridge into Limansk.</p>
</details>
<!--Limansk-->
<details id="Limansk">
<summary>Limansk<span class="icon">&or;</span></summary>
<p>Limansk is full of zombies, they seem to breed like rabbits. A shotgun with darts or slugs work the best (save the Gauss for mutants). Make your way through the city to meet Borman, a Freedom Master. He gives you the <i>Help Borman</i> task that has several steps to it. Continue on through the city and clear out the construction site. You get a task update when you get the last Monolith sniper. At some point you get an SMS to <i>Meet with Professor Sakharov</i>, which you can ignore for now. With the construction site clear, go outside to the west and find the radio jammer in an open shipping container. Take the jammer back to Skinflint at the Freedom Base in Army Warehouses. Skinflint needs five hours to work on the jammer. Now go meet Astrologer in the Rookie Village.</p>

<p>Astrologer asks for Fang's map and then asks you to kill Panther. Tell him you'll think about it and that you must see Sidorovich about something (which is just an excuse to leave). You then get an SMS from Fang that Pilgrim is missing and the Pripyat to Old Village transition opens. But before you meet Pilgrim you need to finish in Limansk. So, back to Army Warehouses to pick up the jammer, and then back to Limansk. Put the radio jammer back where you found it (you must drop it from your backpack: you don't get a prompt).</p>

<p>Continue north through the construction site to the Hospital transition. In the hospital, talk to Cat and lead the Loners through a gauntlet of Monolith and Bloodsuckers. When you drop through the hole at the end of the second section, the <a href="#Cat">Find the Black Doctor</a> task is completed and you talk to the Black Doctor. At the end of the rather lengthy conversation, you pass out for a couple of minutes. When you wake up, continue down the stairs and through the doorway. You are then transported to the first section and can talk to Cat if you want (it's optional). Then leave the hospital and report to Borman that the jammer is in place to complete the <i>Help Borman</i> task. Now go from Limansk to Red Forest > Radar > Yantar. Complete the <a href="#Sakharov">Meet with Professor Sakharov</a> task. Go to the <a href="#Charon">Cachein the Wild Territory</a>, back to Limansk for that cache, and on to Old Village.</p>
</details>
<!--Old Village-->
<details>
<summary>Old Village<span class="icon">&or;</span></summary>
<p>When you spawn in Old Village you find yourself in a trap with Pilgrim and one other stalker. Talk to Pilgrim and learn more on the situation. Try to walk through the teleport and you get sent back. Another stalker, Kolmogor, disables the teleport and comes in. Talk to him to get the <a href="#Kolmogor">Help Kolmogor</a> task. This leads to the <i>Help capture the headquarters</i> task. As you complete the task and enter the house, you get an SMS from Panther telling you she wants to meet, but no time or location. Talk to Kolmogor and get the <i>Survey the village</i> task. Upon completing the task, Panther sends another SMS telling you she's in the Swamp.</p>

<p>Complete the <i>Find out where Panther is</i> and <i>Protect the village</i> tasks, talk to Pilgrim about him staying with Panther, and get the <i>Speak with Klenov</i> task. Pick up the <a href="#Charon">Cachein Old Village</a> and head back to Pripyat > Radar > Warlab. At some point, probably near or in Warlab, you get a series of SMS messages about Panther running off.</p>

<div>At this point, it is very difficult to tie the Charon Caches with the storyline. There is nothing in the remaining caches that you probably don't already have as far as weapons, ammo, artifacts, and suits. If you're partial to the Monolith Exoskeleton, you may want to complete the last few cache tasks now.</div>
</details>
<!--Generators-->
<details>
<summary>Generators<span class="icon">&or;</span></summary>
<p>In Warlab, talk to Klenov and he gives you the <a href="#Klenov">Find the psi-antenna</a> task. Complete the task and leave Warlab. As you do, Panther sends you an SMS explaining why she ran away. You send Pilgrim a message telling him you're on your way to him. You must complete all <a href="#Ghost">Ghost tasks</a> before going any further. Check with him in Radar before you go any further.</p>

<p>Go to Old Village and talk to Pilgrim. This starts a series of SMS messages ending with Ghost offering to meet you at CNPP1. At CNPP1, get inside the gate and go west to the road. Follow the road west until it turns northwest and go between the building on the left (south) and a short cement wall on the right (north). You must go under a series of large pipes. You then come up to a Military officer, which you should take out and get Sakharov's bag from him. Be careful of the nearby BTR. Continue west to the next set of pipes. After you pass under the pipes and reach the end of the short wall on the right (north), turn northwest and find Ghost in the northwest corner of the area. Talk to him and he leads you back the way you came to a gate just east of where you encountered the Military officer and BTR. Ghost stops here for you to talk again. Then, proceed to the transition.</p>

<p>In Generators, talk with Ghost and he leads you to the Loner camp. In the camp, approach the guarded doorway and get an SMS that you must talk with Countryman. He gives you a choice of paying for information or the <i>Shoot down the helicopter</i> task. Take your Gauss to the road at the north part of the map (it takes less than two minutes to get there), and find the helicopter high overhead. When the chopper crashes, go back to Countryman and report. He tells you of a scientist, Andersen, that escaped the base and is being guarded by Fritz. Go talk to Anderson. As you do, another helicopter arrives carrying Black Doctor. Talk to Black Doctor, then to Ghost, then back to Black Doctor to get a ride to the Swamps and the <a href="#BlackDoc">Find Boatswain</a> task. Walk up to the helicopter behind the landing gear to get on board.</p>

<p>Back at the Generators, talk to Boatswain and then to Andersen to get the <i>Bring the gamepad</i> task. Using the map in the Detailed Task Information, go to location 5 and climb up from the northwest using the tree branch/root and find the gamepad on top. Take it back to the camp, talk to Andersen, and then to Boatswain to get the <i>Disable the Psi-antennas</i> task. Take Boatswain to the base as far as possible until a counter starts and you have eight seconds to get back out of the danger zone. Talk to Boatswain again and wait for him to disable the antennas, then return. Sometimes Boatswain gets stuck in the base, so be sure to watch your map and save when he gets close to the base. When he returns, go back to camp and talk to Ghost, then wait for SMSs from Fritz and Black Doctor's associate, Sapsan. Talk to Ghost again to get the <i>Save Panther</i> task and start for the base's front gate.</p>

<p>After clearing the base, you get a message to check the tunnel between the fire pit and guard tower. You may encounter a couple more Monoliths down there. When you reach the other end of the tunnel, you see Astrologer getting into a helicopter and Panther lies dead. A series of SMSs comes in and Black Doctor heads your way. When he gets there, talk to him and then to Ghost. Head back to camp and talk to Boatswain, then again to Ghost to get <i>Panther's Notebook</i> with the code to open the Generators to Warlab door. This prompts another series of SMSs with Black Doctor ending with the <i>Get the dossier</i> task.</p>

<p>First, go to the base and open the coded door. This opens into the stairs leading from Radar to the Warlab. So, you go up the stairs to Radar and down the stairs to Warlab. Anyway, once you open the door, go back to the Generators and complete the dossier task. With the dossier, open your inventory, put the dossier in your pistol/weapon 2 slot, close your inventory, and activate the dossier. It's in Russian, but you really don't need to read it as there is more SMSs and you go to Unexplored Land (and bring your Firefighter suit) with the <i>Find the cave</i> task.</p>
</details>
<!--SavingFly-->
<details id="Girl">
<summary>Saving Fly<span class="icon">&or;</span></summary>
<p>In Unexplored Land, there is a plateau in the far northwest corner with large boulders. You can see someone on your minimap and bioradar. Low-crouch under the boulders to find the cave opening and complete the <i>Find the cave</i> task. You message Fang and he replies that you should come to the Fire Cave before trying to enter. Put your Firefighter suit on and head for the Fire Cave. Talk to Fang and then lead him back to the secret cave. To do this, you must stay in the valley and go north, and then west as Fang will not follow you up the steep incline.</p>

<p>At the cave, Fang disables the teleport protecting the entrance. Go down two ladders to the girl, Fly, and talk to her. Fang sends a message that someone is coming, so leave the cave and wait with him for the helicopter to land. When Panther and Astrologer get out go talk to Panther, and then back to Fang. Lead Fly to Hermit's camp. Along the way you exchange messages with Panther, and when you enter the camp you get a message from Gynecologist. Go talk to him and get the <i>Get the artifacts from Klenov</i> task. Talk to Fly and get the <a href="#Fly">Find an old doll</a> task, talk to Fang, and then head for Radar. As you travel, you will need a Ruby Spring artifact in the very near future, which you should have in your cache. Get the artifacts from Klenov and Fly's doll, then return to Hermit's camp. Give Fly her doll, talk to Fang, and head back to Rostok and talk with Voronin.</p>

<p>Voronin agrees to help, but needs a few minutes before he sends a message about the helicopter crashing in CNPP2. This gives you the <i>Find the flight recorder</i> task. You have a few options for getting to CNPP2. The shortest way without using the URT is Rostok > Army Warehouses > Radar > X16 > Sarcophagus > CNPP2. Use the procedure for <a href="#Charon">Cacheat the ChNPP-2</a> to get to the helicopter. Continue the procedure and take the staircase all the way down. To the northeast is another helicopter with two black armored bodies. Get the information from both to get the <i>Get to the crashed helicopter from the ventilation stack</i> task and either jump down to the ground using the tanks and pipes, or go back over the rail on the west side of the platform and follow the linear teleport path to get near the water tower. There are some Monoliths waiting there for you. There is also an anomaly at the bottom of the ladder.</p>

<div>The Sarcophagus to CNPP2 transition is in the northeast corner of the Wish Granter room (upper level). The Sarcophagus to X-10 transition is in the northwest corner of the Wish Granter room.</div>

<p>Stand on the edge of the anomaly and drop the Ruby Spring artifact from your backpack (don't use the Gravity Gun). There is a white flash and the anomaly is gone. Climb up the ladders to the catwalk giving you access to the helicopter pilot. Get the artifact, make your way back down (you can continue up for a bonus cache if you like), and use the ladder from the ground to the roof of the building southwest of the stack. This puts you back into the teleport gauntlet and to Pripyat. Take the black box to Voronin and head back to Hermit's camp to tell Fly about the helicopter that will take her to her grandfather. Talk to Fly and then wait for the helicopter to come in from the north. Fly tells everyone goodbye and leaves. Notice the box of ammo left as your reward. Talk to Fang and then head east to the swamp.</p>

<p>At the swamp, give the crew member a medkit. Talk to him to start more messages and go Army Warehouses > Radar > Warlab > Generators. Talk to Andersen and get the <i>Disable the jammers</i> task. Go out the south opening in the wall (watching for mines) and to the east side of the small fenced-in area. There are two openings in the fence, each guarded by an anomaly. However, you can jump onto the top of the fence and then drop down inside. To disable the three jammers:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Get as close to the teleport in the southeast corner and jump the fence. You should see the first jammer on the east side of the southeast transformer.</li>
	<li>Go west between the transformers to find the second jammer on the north side of the southwest transformer.</li>
	<li>Turn north to pick up the third jammer on the west side of the center transformer.</li>
	<li>Now go to the northeast corner and find the fourth jammer inside the broken-down transformer structure. Notice the backpack cache.</li>
	<li>Go back to the teleport in the southeast corner that puts you on top of the southeast transformer.</li>
	<li>Sprint-jump northwest to the outside edge of the center transformer, taking care not to step on a mine.</li>
	<li>Sprint-jump to the southwest transformer and collect the cache in the stash box.</li>
	<li>Sprint-jump to the northwest transformer and pick up the last jammer.</li>
	<li>Jump back over the fence and report to Andersen.</li>
</ol>

<p>Andersen asks you to speak with Vitamin about cooperating their efforts. A meeting takes place and they decide you need to clear out Monolith in the north. This task doesn't appear on your PDA's Tasks list. Take out any Monolith at the northern gate, then go to the center of the map to observe the third generator (directly south). Once you are in position, a series of messages are sent until the generator starts operating. Fang sends you a message to meet in CNPP2. Before you leave, check the area for another stalker and go talk to them.</p>

<p>Meet Fang at the northeast corner of a long building just west of the ventilation shaft where you found the Heart of the Poltergeist artifact. He tells you of a plan to ambush Astrologer. Go east to the northeast corner of the building north of the spot marked on the Detailed Task Information tab of your PDA. You send a message to Fang that you're in position and several Monoliths spawn all around you. As you fight them off Fang sends you a message to return to the meeting spot. As you approach, Fang drives off in a BTR to intercept Astrologer's helicopter. When he does, there is a large explosion. Follow after Fang and clean up any surviving Monoliths. You get a message from Black Doctor telling you to return to the Hospital.</p>

<p>At the Hospital, go to the third section again to find Panther in a stand-off with Black Doctor's men. A few messages and they all put their guns down. Use the mound east of Panther to access the second level and make your way around to the Black Doctor. Talk to him, then to Panther's Father, then again to Black Doctor. Go into the room with the white circle and drop the Heart of the Poltergeist. There's the usual white flash, followed by a second white flash to let you know that the transformation is complete. Take the Good Luck Stone artifact and talk to Black Doctor again. Choose to save the girl and go to the alcove north of her. Drop the Good Luck Stone artifact in and go talk to the revived Fly. Next, talk to Panther and leave using the south transition to Agroprom. There's no need to wait for Fly.</p>

<p>In Agroprom, talk to Ghost, then wait for the helicopters to land and have a meeting. As they all fly off, Arhara shows up. Talk to him and then to the other stalker waiting by the Cordon transition. Jump into the teleport bubble to land on top of the Agroprom factory smoke stack. Jump down into the next teleport bubble to land in the watch tower nearby. Wait for a series of messages and then head for the Bar.</p>
</details>
<!--Lighting-->
<details>
<summary>Finding Lighting<span class="icon">&or;</span></summary>
<p>At the Bar, talk to Associate Professor to get the bug removed from your PDA and trade messages with Lighting. Use the URT or go to Army Warehouses > Radar > X-10 > Sarcophagus > Monolith Control to find Lighting in the northwest part of the map. Give her a medkit and talk to her to get the <i>Find the wanderer in Limansk</i> task. Now go back the way you came and go Radar > Red Forest > Limansk. Make your way north through the Construction Site to the house shown in the Detailed Task Information image of your PDA. You may notice a dead stalker to the east, which is the wonderer. However, you must use the teleport to get to that location. Enter the house from either the south or east entrance and use the ladder in the southeast room to the attic. Crouch to get through the east window and work your way west to the teleport bubble. You spawn in an enclosed area with the dead wonderer west of your location. Pick up his notebook and read the entry. Now go back east to where you spawned and turn north to find the teleport back to the house with the first teleport. A Loner, Yuri Semetsky, comes out of the north side of the house. Talk to him to open a transition to the Generators and learn about some 5.45x39 Isomorph ammo in the same room of the house as the ladder.</p>

<p>Trade messages with Ghost and go to Generators. Find Ghost and Maximilian in the northwest corner of the map. Talk to Maximilian and get the <a href="#Maximilian">Find the Teleporter in the Sarcophagus</a> and <i>Take a photo</i> tasks. Take the picture back to Maximilian and talk to Ghost. Put the Isomorphicdetector on your belt (it requires two spaces). Your next task comes after you trade messages with Fang, <a href="#Fang">Open the door</a>, for which you need your camouflaged exoskeleton. This starts a series of <a href="#Fang">Fang tasks</a> ending with <i>Find the Forester</i>. Picking up from the Devilish Encampment, go north to the tank, where there's more big game. A transition to the Warlab is in a cave northwest of the tank, but the cave has a couple of land mines in it. Plus, as you approach, a pack of dogs and pseudodogs spawn. Jump on the boulders nearby to deal with the mutants. Then, shoot the mines from a distance to blow them up without taking any damage. The transition puts you in the Warlab basement. Go north, then east and up the ladder. Go up the stairs and around to the doorway in the northwest corner of the room, around the hole in the floor to the doorway in the northeast corner. This hallway puts you near the elevator shafts where you can use the far one to access the third level and talk to Klenov. He gives you the <a href="#Klenov">Take photos for Klenov</a> task. Once you complete this task, head back to Monolith Control Center to <i>Meet Lightning</i>.</p>

<p>Again, go Radar > X-10 > Sarcophagus > Monolith Control and talk to Lightning. Drop the Crystal Isomorph and Globe Isomorph into the teleport. If you don't see a white flash, pick the item up, move closer to the teleport, and try again. Have your big game weapon ready should you need it. Talk to Lightning again and follow her instructions. However, she doesn't send you to Yantar but to Garbage instead. You get a message from Panther in the Rookie Village and go see her. At the transition is a Loner named Hog, who needs your help and gives you the <i>Return the stalker's belongings</i> task. This is a good opportunity to use the Isomorphicdetector for useful artifacts, and Hog gives you some information that will be helpful in the near future. After you kill about 10 fleshes, you find the one you need. The reward is at the base of the large tree northeast of Hog. At the village, talk to Panther's father and follow him to Panther, but stay near the top of the hill. After exchanging messages with Panther's father, follow him back to the village and talk to him again to get the <i>Find the killer</i> task.</p>

<p>This starts a series of messages with Klenov, then Ghost, and finally Chernomor. Go back to Yantar (by way of Garbage > Agroprom) and talk to Chernomor. He sends you back to the Rookie Village to use the camera and determine which stalker is the Last Day member. Go to the peak of the house south of the bonfire and use the binoculars as before to locate the target area. Use the camera and put the picture in the pistol slot to view. Then, go talk to that stalker, and give the picture to Panther's father. Now get your camouflaged exoskeleton and move on to <i>Find the stranger at the Freedom base</i>.</p>

<p>The PDA Detailed Task Information for the task shows the watch tower on the south end of the bridge. Climb the stairs to the top platform and stand on the northwest corner. Find the target area with the binoculars and take the shot. Then, go down and talk to the Last Day member to get the <i>Overhear the conversation</i> task. Now head for the Unexplored Land transition from Army Warehouses. The large boulder is near, on the right side of the path. It's a good idea to clear the area of mutants first, to avoid the meeting participants from getting distracted. Stand on top at the east edge to get a message that you're in the right spot and wait until the meeting to overhear the plan. When Evil of Last Day leaves, go down and talk to Maximilian. There is a message exchange between Maximilian and Evil, and then you get the <i>Find the teleport and use it</i> task.</p>

<p>Keep your camouflaged exoskeleton with you and go to Agroprom. Enter the Military base from the north and go through the opening in the wall on the left (southeast from the north gate) near the tower. Go to the tree in the northeast corner and, from the northeast side, jump to the first limb. Turn north to find the backpack. Take the contents to Sakharov and ask him about the teleport. On the north side of the helicopter there is a blade touching the ground. Use this to get on top and, continuing south, move to the teleport. In X-16, collect the artifacts and document, read the document, and then go to the east and locate the cable with the teleport. Low-crouch under the rail and drop down to the cable. Contrary to the instructions, go up the cable and into the teleport. This puts you inside the container with the brain. Shoot the brain with an assault rifle. This may take 60-90 rounds, depending on the rifle. You are transported to the hanger roof in the factory complex. Move to the east edge near the north side and drop down to the tank below. Use the ladder to reach the ground and go out the front gate. Talk to Chernomor again and report to Lighting. Drop one artifact into the teleport, pick up the items that are returned, and watch Lighting leave. You then get the <i>Find and activate the portal</i> task.</p>

<!--Dead City-->
<details id="Dead">
<summary>Dead City<span class="icon">&or;</span></summary>
<div>The teleport to Dead City has a security system that prohibits any weapons except a knife or sword, 9x19 and 9x18 pistols with magazine capacities of 13 or less, sawn-off shotguns, and what ever suit you're wearing. You will have a chance to pick up weapons that use 9x19mm, 5.45x39mm, and 5.56x45mm ammo, along with Gauss batteries. You can also take under-barrel grenade launchers. The Gravity Gun is also prohibited. There's a safe to store the prohibited items and it's recommended that you bring your favorite weapons to store there. Also, bring an anomalous M-16 and the camouflaged exoskeleton suit.</div>

<p>In Limansk, go to the north side of the Gastronom building and push your way through the door. The next door is slightly open and you can shoot the box blocking (or use a knife). Sprint to the first pillar (either side) and staying out of the line of fire, toss a grenade or two toward the far side of the room. The security system explodes and you may take some damage. Walk up to the keypad and enter the numbers on the note in the cigar box you got when you dropped the artifact in Lighting's teleport. Now walk over to the white circle on the floor, but not too close, and drop the cigar box into the teleport in front of the switch. If you get too close you get transported to the north side of the room. When you drop the cigar box, a white light flashes and some ammo spawns at your feet. Now stand in the white circle, pull the switch, and you are transported to the room with the Dead City portal. You must remove all weapons indicated in the warning. Also, remove the URT and Monolith Teleport. Walk up to the teleport in the center of the room and get transported to Dead City (after the cut-scene).</p>

<p>In Dead City, you are greeted by Evil, Last Day's leader. Talk to him and move around the city's west side. Keep to the outside of the map to avoid the city's protection system. If you get too close a timer starts and you have five seconds to get a safe distance away. You get a message from Perfumer, who is waiting at a large pipe coming out of the city's northeast side. Talk to him, and then to Sanya the Tyumen, leader of the Loners. Sanya gives you the <a href="#Sanya">Rob the bandit camp</a> task. Complete this task and get a message from Perfumer giving you the <a href="#Perfumer">Find and protect, if necessary, the controller</a> task. After you talk to Norman there is a series of messages with Obmorok ending with him giving you a meeting location. Again, stay to the outside of the map to avoid Obmorok's men from seeing you. If they do, try to avoid contact (you may need to Quick Save when you reach the meeting spot and load the save to get them to retreat). Find the fuel truck and walk behind it to trigger a message to Obmorok that you're at the meeting spot and get the <i>Get out of Dead City</i> task. Talk to him and he gives you the Positioner, which goes in your pistol slot and gives you 10 minutes inside the first security belt.</p>

<p>Put Norman's map in your pistol slot to see the cache is northwest of the square. Put the Positioner in your pistol slot, enter the city from the northwest, and take out any resistance along the way. There are two doors facing the northwest. The left (west) stairway is heavily guarded, but provides direct access to the cache. The right (north) stairway is unguarded, but requires you to walk up a beam and jump on top of the walls to get to the cache in the southwest part of the attic. Get the items in the cache and put Norman's crossbow in your rifle slot. Move northeast to the platform overlooking the square. When you are in position, you send a message, but your weapon may become inaccessible. If this happens, move back away from the square until you can draw your weapon again. Don't be distracted by what's happening on the southwest part of the square. Focus on the Sports Complex building on the opposite (northeast) side. You may need to move back into the attic until you can draw your weapon again. Watch the ground floor for a green scientific suit. Unless you get a headshot, you need to hit him twice. Remember to shoot high as the darts will drop a little. Once you kill the <i>Head of Area Protection</i>, sprint for the ATP teleport, which is between the southeast road and south corner of the map. Don't wait for it to show on your map, get to the area as soon as you can.</p>

<p>As you make your way to the transition, watch for a Last Day squad either before or after you jump to ATP. You must kill them all in order to get the next task from Norman, <a href="#Norman">Find the cache in the Agroprom</a>. Once you have the Teleport Module, get your camouflaged exoskeleton and an anomalous M-16. Go back to Limansk and make your way to the Gastronom building again. Notice the Dead City transition on the south side of the building. Before using it, go back into the basement, stand in the white circle to be teleported to the secret room, and retrieve your equipment from the safe. This Dead City teleport no longer works. To leave the secret room, throw the switch in the northeast corner of the room. Now use the transition south of the building.</p>

<p>You spawn on the road going into the city from the northwest. Looking at the map, this is the transition to Limansk. There is also a transition to Wild Territory on the road going southwest, and the ATP transition on the southeast road still shows on the map. However, you get a message that it is disabled. You also get messages from Obmorok and Sakharov (asking about his wife). The west corner of the city is circled to show Perfumer's approximate location. Go to the house in that corner and talk to him. Perfumer calls Duda to make arrangements. When he finishes, talk to him again to get the <a href="#Perfumer">Release the hostage</a> task.</p>

<p>With Doc free, there are more messages. Wait to leave the building until you get a message that Zone A is disabled, then go out the back (southeast) door and make your way north to the building on the northeast side of the square. Clear the building and find Lighting. While you exchange messages, you cannot draw your weapon until there is a white flash. Then, you get a message from Perfumer to find Sparks' note (this task is not listed on your PDA). The note is behind Lenon's bust in the entryway of the southwest building. Pick it up and Perfumer walks through the front door. Talk to him and then use the Positioner to find the transition, which is in front of the school. Walk into the portal to go underground. Walk northwest, a message is sent to Perfumer, who wants to join you, but don't wait. Move ahead and blow up the barrels as you go. The dynamite boxes don't blow until you walk past them, but don't do much damage. Eventually, you get to the Zaton transition.</p>

<div>Both large buildings on the northeast and southwest side of the square have caches on the roof. The northeast building also has a security system like the basement in Limansk. There is also a cache in the room where you met Duda.</div>
</details>
<!--Zaton-->
<details>
<summary>Zaton<span class="icon">&or;</span></summary>

<div>At the time of this writing, many of the conversations had not been translated to English yet. So, not all of the tips and instructions are clear.</div>

<p>You spawn in the Zaton sewer near the Stingray 5 crash site with Norman and Perfumer. A Monolith squad tries to stop you, but Norman takes them out. You examine Stingray 5 while the others head to the stalker camp. Examine the dead soldier and put his notebook in your pistol slot to view the drawing. You get a message from Perfumer that you're needed at the stalker camp, which is just northeast of Stingray 5. Approach the Loners and get a message from Robinson, their leader. Talk to him and get the <i>Meet with Beard</i> task.</p>

<p>Continue north up the road, through the Sawmill, to the house on the north side. Find Beard in the northwest corner of the house and talk to him. The conversation is interrupted by a message that two Bandits were caught. Go out the front door to find Obmorok and Kit from Dead City. Go back into the house and up the ladder to the attic. The stash box is at the north end. Get the weapons and talk to Beard again, who is now back in his original spot inside the house. He gives you the <i>Get to the barges</i> task. Then, go out and talk to Obmorok first and Kit next. Follow Kit up the hill to the radio equipment and talk to him. Then, go back and tell Obmorok that you're ready. Follow him to the Skadovsk and talk to him when he stops outside the door. You may need to open the door for him if he gets stuck. Talk to Karagoz, the bartender, then up two sets of stairs to Grandfather, the Bandit leader. He sends you back to Karagoz with the <i>Examine the barge</i> task. Go to the repair technician, Serge (in Call of Pripyat, Owl's location), and get the <a href="#Serge">Find oil for Serge the repairman</a> task.</p>

<p>Go out and talk with Kolka the Goby and he guides you to the Shevchenko. Kolka waits outside the ship while you go in. There are dogs and bats to deal with and buckshot is very effective. When you kill the last bat you get an update to talk to Kolka. Do that now before he runs back to the Skadovsk, and you get the <i>Meet the bandits on the old barge</i> task. Next, explore the ship and find the two corpses. The corpse on the very top deck has the transistors you need for Kit. The capacitors are in a stash box sitting on the ledge of the north stack of the ship. To get to it, jump on the north side railing of the top deck and sprint-jump to the beam that connects the two stacks.</p>

<p>You can find Vaseline in the shack at the Dock Cranes. Talk to him, then go to the Old Barge (Noah's home). Enter through the north side door, turn left, and go up the stairs to the deck. Continue up to the pole going across to a platform and use it. Climb the ladders until you get to the top platform with the satellite dish. This platform is mined, but you should get a message from Fang when you reach the top of the ladder. Go back down and talk to Vaseline again and get the <a href="#Vaseline">Explore the situation at the substation</a> task. After finding Vaseline's backpack, take the road north to the Sawmill, give Kit the items from the Shevchenko, and talk to Beard. He gives you the <a href="#Beard">Find the strange hunter</a> task. Complete the <a href="#Bloodsucker">Follow the Bat</a> task, return with the documents, and talk to Bloodsucker Hunter.</p>

<p>Return to the substation and drop down the elevator shaft. Use a Gauss on the moving green anomaly and proceed north to the doorway on the left. Go to the locked door in the northwest corner of the room and wait for the door to be unlocked. Go through the door and continue north to the stairs on the left. Go up the stairs and talk to Elsa. She gives you the <i>Work as a postman</i> task. Now go southwest to the passage going west and drop down into the drain pipe (you must throw a bolt to discharge the Electro anomaly, or wait for the anomaly to cycle like the one in Cordon). Go south to the Dead City transition, and then to Wild Territory > Yantar. Talk to Sakharov to complete the <i>Work as a postman</i> task and get the <a href="#Sakharov">Return to the bar in Zaton</a> task. When you talk to Karagoz, he gives you the <a href="#Karagoz">Detect the thief</a> task. Complete the task and he gives you the <i>Meet with the hunters</i> task. This takes you to a camp southwest of the Oakpine anomaly, back to the Skadovsk to talk to Grandfather, then to the Substation Workshop.</p>

<p>When you finish with Broadway, you get a message from an unknown sender to meet at the Waste Processing Station in the southeast part of the map, and you get the <i>Explorer the garbage factory</i> task. When you get to the specified location on the first floor, you are attacked and pass out. When you come to, Bloodsucker Hunter is there and your money is gone. Talk to him and he gives you the <a href="#Bloodsucker">Find the bloodsucker</a> task. After that, he gives you the <i>Find a device with a sensor for the bloodsucker</i> task. When you finish with Bloodsucker Hunter, head for the Dangerous Cave to <a href="#Scarab">Find the military survivor</a>.</p>

<p>Talk to Bernie and get the <i>Detect and find the drone</i> task. Immediately step out of the cave and look to the northeast sky to find the drone. Shoot it until it begins to smoke, then take the road south over the bridge and go west, passing on the north side of the Krug Antenna Complex. Find the drone west of the antenna complex, pick up the photo device, and return to Bernie. Talk to him to complete the task and get the <i>Speak with Elsa Sakharov</i> task.</p>

<p>Make your way back to the Krug Antenna Complex building and down the elevator shaft. Talk to Elsa and get the <i>Find Guilder</i> task. Guilder's camp is just south of the Dredging Barge, so this is a good time to pick up <a href="#Serge">Serge's oil</a>. Then, talk to Guilder and get the <i>Spark. Release.</i> task. Follow Guilder south along the road. When he turns east, stop at the guardrail. If you get too close to the building you die instantly. When you get a task update, return to Guilder's camp. You get another update and send a message to Perfumer to meet in Bernie's cave. Lead the group there, talk to Bernie, and then talk to Guilder. Lead Sparks south down the road to Bloodsucker Hunter's where Perfumer is waiting. Talk with Sparks and she gives you the code. You get the <i>Find the code in the protection control room in Dead City</i> task.</p>
</details>
<!--Last Day's Last Day-->
<details>
<summary>Last Day's Last Day<span class="icon">&or;</span></summary>

<p>In Dead City, you spawn at the west corner of the building that you need to enter. Take cover in the nearest door and work your way to the second floor. Use the code you got from Sparks to open the coded door and find the laptop. When you pick it up you get a task update to see Elsa. Leave the building out of the south door and get to the portal in front of the school. Follow the tunnel to the Zaton transition. In Zaton, go back and talk to Elsa. Approach the control panel in the west hallway by waiting for the Electro anomaly to cycle off and jump over the opening. Try the code from the laptop, but it doesn't work. Go back and talk to Elsa again. She sends you to Sparks, who needs 10 minutes to work on it (a timer starts). This is a good time to take Serge's oil to him in the Skadovsk. When you return (and the timer runs out), talk to Sparks to find the correct code. Go back to the control panel and enter the correct code to complete the task. You get a message from Evil and the <i>Meet with Evil</i> task.</p>

<p>Go to the Ranger Station and meet with Evil on the second floor of the large building. Don't get too close, just close enough to open the talk dialog. The conversation doesn't go well, so be ready to close the dialog quickly and shoot Evil in the face. Clear out the rest of Last Day's men and get a message from Bland, and you get the <i>Meet with Bland</i> task. This meeting is at the Waste Processing Station. Go south, either over the bridge or down through the valley, and find Bland on the second floor. Talk to him to complete the task. Next, you get a message from Fang and the <i>Meet fang at the gas station</i> task. Go west down the road to the Gas Station and find Fang, Ghost, Arhara, and Pilgrim. Talk to Fang to complete the task and get the <i>Eliminate the Last Day faction</i> task.</p>

<p>Head southwest to the Iron Forest and fight your way to the southwest corner. While your comrades take on a constant stream of Last Day fighters, go west to where the wall ends and go up the slope. This puts you directly north of the building with the lab entrance. Get to the stairs and open the door. Follow the passage to the stairs and down to the first door (going north). Continue north to the next set of stairs and go to the bottom. You get a message from Lighting that she wants to talk. Find her at the far end of the room. Talk to her and watch her leave. Then, move away from the device and toss a grenade at it to blow it up. There may be a few more Last Day fighters between you and the exit. When you get out, you find your three friends made it, too. Talk to Arhara and the game is done. You can free play now.</p>

<p>At the end of the <a href="#Dan">Get the Unusual Parcel for Dan</a>, Dan sends you back to Arhara for another task. When you return to Agroprom, Arhara may still be fighting with the Military at the institute, with Adrenaline in the factory, or somewhere in between. Arhara offers the following tasks:</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>Bring the notebook to Arhara</b> - This involves getting to the far side of the Agroprom Underground traveling Electro anomaly, getting the notebook, and giving it to Arhara.</li>

He tells you to keep them to bargain with Sakharov's wife.</li>
	<li><b>Find the bloodsucker</b> - Among a group of friendly bloodsuckers is one troublemaker. Bloodsucker Hunter wants you to go north through the Burnt Farmstead, continue northeast down into the ravine, and up the hill on the other side. The trick is to determine which is the bad bloodsucker and kill it before it stirs the others up against you. Walk through the area until one of them attacks and blast it with your Gauss. Return to the Izumrudnoye and get the <i>Find a device with a sensor for the bloodsucker</i> task.</li>

<p>Cat is a sick man and needs help with the following tasks:</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>Search the corpse of a Monolith and find a map for Cat</b> - Follow Cat to the Burnt Farmstead. Along the way, there's an Avenger waiting to ambush you. And if you haven't killed the electrified bloodsucker yet, you'll need to do that now. Then, loot the corpse and talk to Cat. He goes back to the Clear Sky base to rest. The next time you're at the base, talk to him about the next task.</li>
	<li><b>Find the remaining Monoliths, Cat needs their personal notebooks</b> - The first part of this task doesn't show on your PDA. You need to find someone on the Clear Sky base that can help find the Monoliths. Go into the lab (Professor Kalancha's lab) and find Kostik Sharptoothed. As with all Zone characters, Kostik wants something in exchange, a television. Just like the one next to Akim in Cordon. Bring the television to Kostik and he gives you possible locations of the remaining two Monoliths on your map. Check each location, kill the Monoliths, and bring the notebook back to Cat. Cat needs more time to study the notes and suggests meeting at the Bar.</li>
	<li><b>Get Kalmyk's medicine for Cat</b> - Meet up with Cat again at the Bar and he gives you this task. This is a different type of medicine than what you got for Vasily. See <a href="#Kalmyk">Kalmyk</a> for instructions.</li>
	<li><b>Get information of the Monolith in the Agroprom for Cat</b> - South of the Agroprom Institute building (where you met Arhara), find the Monolith and two Loners. Kill the Monolith and talk to the Loners. You may encounter a bug here where the Loners pick up weapons from the fallen Monolith and attack the Military in the institute complex. There doesn't seem to be any other option than to kill everything in the area so that you can talk to the Loners. If that happens, you can grab <a href="#Lukash">Lukash's dynamite</a> on the second floor. When you can talk to the Loners, they ask you to guide them to the factory complex. Once they are safe, talk to them again to get more information. Take the information back to Cat and he gives you the <i>Find the trader Rabinovich</i> task.</li>
	<li><b>Find the trader Rabinovich</b> - In Pripyat, go through the underground car park and north up the road on the east side of the hotel. Just past the hotel and before you get to the Ferris Wheel, you can see a neutral stalker in the building on the east side. Use the rubble to climb up and into the open window. In the next room is Rabinovich. Talk to him until he gives you the information you're after, then he collapses. Eventually, he becomes hostile and you have to put him down. You get a task update to return to Cat, and a new task <a href="#Cat">Find the Black Doctor</a>. Back at the Bar, Cat suggest talking to <a href="#Zahar">Zahar</a> to find a way to Limansk, the Black Doctor's location.</li>
	<li><b>Find the Black Doctor</b> - Make your way through <a href="#Limansk">Limansk</a> to the Hospital. Talk to Cat and lead him through the first two sections. The first section is guarded by Monolith. There are two options for advancing into the second section:
		<ul>
			<li>The upper level has a hole in the wall in the southeast corner.</li>
			<li>The lower level has a doorway in the south wall.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>The second section has more Monolith plus two electrified Bloodsuckers. Get to the upper level, southwest corner and drop through the hole in the floor to complete the task.</p>

		</ul>
	</li>
	<li><b>Cachewith teleport</b> - You need one Sparkler and one Chimera Tears artifact on your belt to make the Monolith teleport work, and be able to take on 120 kgs (if you plan to clean the cache out). And if you're too far away from the target, the teleport spawns Monolith instead:
		<ol>
			<li>In CNPP2, go through the gauntlet of Monolith and teleports until you get to the teleport surrounded by skulls on sticks. This is the teleport that briefly sends you back to Sidorovich.</li>
			<li>Go through the teleport and make your way around to the platform.</li>
			<li>At the top of the stairs, turn east toward the cylinder with louvers.</li>
			<li>Jump to the roof and slowly walk up to the cylinder while looking below the bottom louver to find the backpack.</li>
			<li>Take the teleport and put the artifacts on your belt. Then activate the teleport.</li>
		</ol>
		<p>The teleport takes you into one of the large spheres to the north. There are four small stash boxes full of goodies. Activate the teleport again and you are back at the louvered cylinder. Where ever you are when you teleport to the cache, you are then teleported back to that same spot. Again, if you are too far away from the cache, the teleport is disabled and several Monolith spawn.</p>

					<li>At the bottom of the elevator shaft, several snorks come to greet you. You can move from the ladder to the top of the elevator to shoot through the opening. Be aware that the snorks can jump through the opening.</li>
					<li>From the elevator, turn left (north) and take the left tunnel.</li>

					<li>Stay left as you progress and take the medallion from the Bandit.</li>
					<li>To exit, stay right to get back to the area with the pillars.</li>
					<li>Cross the area in a southeast direction and take the passage on the right to get back to the elevator.</li>
					<li>Up the elevator shaft ladder and follow the passage back, staying left at the first tunnel connection.</li>
					<li>Turn left (north) and follow the passage back, taking the first left to get to the transition out to Dark Valley.</li>
				</ol>
			</li>
			<li>From Army Warehouses:

<ul>
	<li><b>Find Denis in the Red Forest and rescue him</b> - When you enter the mine a white light flashes, and then everything goes black. Continue on to the open area that has boards covering the opening below. At this point two Controllers spawn, one at the entrance and one deeper in the mine. Use the mine carts as cover to take out the Controller at the entrance. Also, several civilian zombies spawn deeper (west) in the mine. Toss a few grenades and watch for kamikaze rats. Find and kill the second Controller. Go down to the lower level and into the bathroom. This spawns a Bloodsucker that you can take out with the Gauss. When you are sure the mine is clear of mutants go back to the first intersecting passage with the large room to the north. Go north through the open gate. Follow the passage left to find Denis and give him a medkit. Agree to escort him to the stalker camp at the north gate. This spawns a band of Mercenaries. You can go south to the closed gate and take out two or three, then go back around to get out of the mine. Use the mine carts as cover and keep moving forward. If Denis is killed the task fails, and he is not very good about staying behind you.</li>
	<li><b>Bring the documents from the Red Forest to Fang</b> - Go to the tunnel leading to the Devilish encampment and talk to the Hunter. There is a possible bug here where there is no <b>Talk(F)</b> prompt and he yells at you in Russian (I think). Go toward the Devilish encampment and north toward the tank to find the bodies of some Hunters and some bears. Then go back and try to talk to the Hunter in the tunnel again. Tell him you're there on business. He tells you about a Loner stealing a backpack and suggests you ask around about where the Loner might be. Go back to the north gate and to Forester's building. Go inside and talk to the guard about who he's guarding. Then ask if the thief had a backpack. He gives you the backpack. Take it to the Hunter, who then tells you the documents are in another backpack near the tank. Go north to the tank (check the hatch for loot) and find the backpack on the ground on the north side.</li>
	<li><b>Open the door</b> - Fang suggests standing near the Sarcophagus transition, but I prefer to wait along the east wall until everyone has come down the stairs and then go up into that hallway for better cover since you must remove your camouflaged exoskeleton suit before you can shoot. Go to the spot Fang suggests in the southeast corner to trigger a message exchange with Fang. This results in the <i>Don't let the radio operator die</i> task. Next, put on your camo exo and wait. When the stairs is clear, go up, through the doorway (out of sight), and take off your camo exo. As soon as the door opens, clear the room (accept for the radio operator), and then talk to the radio operator.</li>
	<li><b>Don't let the radio operator die</b> - This task overlaps the <i>Open the door</i> task, which completes as soon as the door is open, and the <i>Find the radio operator's cache</i> task. After talking with the radio operator, talk to Fang, take the camera and document, and go to the Pripyat Kindergarten. Use the south gate and enter the building from the doorway on the right (east). Make your way through the rooms and hallways to the stairs. Go up the stairs and make your way back south to the door with a sign hanging on it. This prompts a message to Fang. Enter the room and through the doorway on the right (west). The safe is on the right and two isomorph items in the next room. Collect the camera lens and globe and wait for Fang and the radio operator to show up. Talk to Fang after the radio operator opens the safe to complete the task.</li>
	<li><b>Find the radio operator's cache</b> - Pripyat Kindergarten, second floor, south end of east wing.</li>
	<li><b>Find the Forester</b> - Back to Red Forest and to the Mining Complex. Go talk to Forester and get the <a href="#Forester">Find and kill the sniper</a> task. Afterward, go back to Forester and pick up the isomorph pistol before talking to him. From his information about the body he found, go south to the tunnel leading to the Devilish Encampment. There are a few chimeras in the area, so be ready with your big game weapon. Find the body in, or near the pit, along with an isomorph artifact. You can get to the body and artifact, or use the Gravity Gun to pull them both out. The dead Last Day member has a document worth reading.</li>

These are found in the cellar of the third house from the road on the south side in the Rookie Village. The Soul artifact is a reward for completing the <a href="#ClearSky">Bring Tyrant's PDA to the informant</a> task.</li>
	<li><b>Find the box and safe</b> - Bring Fima Coal the <i>Find the necessary items</i> and he tells you about the safe and box, and how to get to the Labyrinth second level. There's no need for a sniper rifle as you'll pick one up on the way. However, you will encounter bloodsuckers and Controllers. I find an M209 or VOG-25 in the face is a quick kill for these mutants.
		<ol>
			<li>See <a href="#Minerbook">Get the book for Miner</a> for instructions on getting to Labyrinth.</li>
			<li>In Labyrinth, take the passage on the right (west).</li>
			<li>Continue west and then north to find a bag with an Iglomet sniper rifle and some needles.</li>
			<li>Continue on to the large opening with anomalies in the center and a desk on the north side. You may also run into a Controller, so be ready for that.</li>
			<li>Find the Firefighter Suit in the green box. Also, there is <i>The note of the stalker</i> artifact recipe. The Google Translation is: <p>I managed to get this recipe!!! I would have known earlier that he is so simple! How many good art was wasted... However, I will be able to take advantage of it already - it's not my destiny to get out of here... If anyone finds an email - enjoy your health. Artifact "Beads of Burer's Grandma" throws itself into the "hot" anomaly. After 5 min. with a probability of 75%, an absolute is obtained, which I called "Burer Probe Beads." Stalker Separator</p></li>
			<li>Start up the east wall, which is slanted, to the opening at the south end. As you start up the wall, you can go to the south so that you are directly west of the opening, and proceed up the wall.</li>
			<li>Follow the passage around to the north where there are three Heat anomalies and a small opening.</li>
			<li>Put the Firefighter Suit on and throw some bolts to activate the anomalies.</li>
			<li>Approach from the southeast through the anomalies and into the opening.</li>
			<li>Follow the passage to where it drops with another passage directly across (north), but too high to reach. This is the exit, or return passage that you'll use later.</li>
			<li>Instead, take the passage on the right (east). When you get to a room, a bloodsucker spawns.</li>
			<li>Continue on to another drop with a passage directly across. This is the other end of the passage that was too high.</li>
			<li>Instead, turn right and find the anomalous room that Fima Coal referred to.</li>
			<li>Move along the north wall until the wall turns.</li>
			<li>Find the Heat anomaly and the Whirligig anomaly with an Electro anomaly bubble just beyond. This is the teleport.</li>
			<li>Throw a bolt to activate the Electro anomaly and sprint into it. Success results in a white flash and you spawn in a new location.</li>
		</ol>
		<p>Congratulations, you made it. Be aware that teleports, unlike transitions, do not autosave. Now for the box and safe:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Take the passage going north down and into a room with the box and a cache in a small wooden box containing a VSS Vintorez lay at the west side. In side the box are two codes.</li>
			<li>Go back up the passage to where you spawned, but continue west to the opening with the red Electro anomaly.</li>
			<li>Throw a bolt as you approach to activate the anomaly and then jump down into the teleport. This takes you back to the area of the first teleport.</li>
			<li>It doesn't matter which way you go, just follow the passage back to the starting point and turn right (south) to go into the large room where you saved Fima Coal.</li>
			<li>See <a href="#Minerbook">Get the book for Miner</a> for instructions on getting to the first coded door. Check each fallen Monolith for a blue book containing another code.</li>
			<li>Use the first code from the box to open the door. If you cannot get to the first door, but can get to the next level (Fima Coal's cell), continue on and use the second code from the box.</li>
			<li>Inside the bunker, make your way to the next locked door.</li>
			<li>Use the code from the blue book to open this door.</li>
			<li>Continue on and find the safe on the top shelf in one of the rooms.</li>

	<li><b>Find and kill the sniper</b> - Go to the top level of Forester's building and stand along the west side looking southwest where the road curves north just before the blockade. Use binoculars to find the sniper and take him out. Then, report back to Forester.</li>

<p>Freeman is an important contact as his help is needed later in the game.</p>
<ol>
	<li><b>Bring the Desert Eagle to Freeman</b>
		<ol>
			<li>Put on an SSP-99 or SSP-99M and any artifacts that increase your burn protection.</li>
			<li>In Wild Territory, go to the train station and crouch-jump into the open window on the northwest side (that faces the direction of the crashed helicopter).</li>
			<li>Leave the room and go southwest to the alcove on the right (opposite the building's front door). </li>
			<li>Find the metal box, open it, take Freeman's gun, and he gives you the <i>Bring the case to Freeman</i> task.</li>
		</ol>
	</li>
	<li><b>Bring the case to Freeman</b> - Talk to Freeman about hanging out in the Bar and the conversation eventually gets to him asking you to speak with James in Wild Territory. You can try talking to James, but the conversation quickly turns ugly. My strategy for this approach is to run out of the trailer and take cover behind the cement slabs north of the trailer door. However, it's much easier to just kill them all and take the case.</li>
	<li><b>Bring Freeman the flashdrive from Bland</b> - This comes when you complete the <a href="#LaHavre">Bring the documents from X-10 to Le Havre</a> task. You must clear the X-18 complex of Bandits and Mercs. I find it easiest to use the Lada to jump over the wall near the back and work my way to the front. When the last one falls, you get an SMS from Bland telling you he will meet and three neutral characters appear on your minimap. Go into the back building and talk to Bland. Give him the 50,000 RUs and take the flash drive to Freeman.

<p>This picks up when you give Barman the Simbion artifact, which you can either make or get from <a href="#Cross">Cross</a> by completing the <i>Bring 15 Artifacts to Cross</i> task.</p>
<ol>
	<li>Give Barkeep the artifact and he tells you more about Ghost's double. He ends the conversation by sending you back to Yantar. This task does not show on your PDA. See <a href="#GhostFang">Ghost and Fang</a> for information on <i>Get the computer for the scientist</i>.</li>
	<li><b>Find Ghost</b> - This task comes with a message from an unknown sender. But you will soon learn that it came from Ghost. Go to Radar and look for Ghost's camp among the boulders. Coming from Army Warehouses, use the opening in the fence where the road curves right (where you first encountered the sniper on the platform). Follow the fence north to the boulder, then follow the boulder west.</li>
	<li><b>Kill Tusk and get his flashdrive</b> - You meet some of Ghost's men just south of the Northern Farmstead, where Tusk is camped. Owl's men attack from the south. I find it effective to loop around the west side where there's some boulders for cover and snipe from a distance. When the camp is clear, start searching bodies for a flash drive. As far as I know, there's no way to save Owl, but I have managed to keep the rest of them alive by drawing most of the fire away from them. Find Owl and take his flash drive to get the <i>Find Owl's Note in Laboratory X-10</i> task.</li>
	<li><b>Kill Tusk. Part 2. Bring the documents to Ghost</b> - Meet Ghost's men in the Rookie Village and attack the southern checkpoint. Use the trees on the west side of the road as cover and RPG the two BTRs. Neutralize the checkpoint and get the document off the now dead Tusk. Take the document back to Ghost to conclude his tasks for the moment. Ghost gives you his Gauss gun. Use it sparingly, if at all. You will need all the batteries you can get soon.</li>
	<!--<li><b>Find the Engineering Plan</b> - </li>-->
	<li><b>Find 2 Gold Chunk artifacts for Ghost</b> - The six spherical structures in the northern part of CNPP2 are surrounded by anomalies with artifacts. You should be able to find two Gold Chuck artifacts, along with other artifacts. Collecting these artifacts is much easier with a Gravity Gun, but can be done by hand. To exit the area, go south around the long building west of the water tower and climb the ladder to the roof of the building near the elevated pipes. Go east on the pipes to the teleport and follow the path to the last teleport taking you back to Pripyat. Completing this task opens a transition between Sarcophagus and CNPP2.</li>
	<li><b>Find the 3 Monolith Diaries in the ChNPP-2 for Ghost</b> - Using the Sarcophagus to CNPP2 transition puts you near the exit from Monolith Control Center. From there, start through the teleports until you get to the building near the northwest location on the Detailed Task Information map in your PDA:
		<ol>
			<li>From the roof, go down the ladder on the east wall that puts you on the elevated walkway.</li>
			<li>Jump over the north rail to the ledge and follow around to the ladder.</li>
			<li>Go down the ladder and turn south to find the backpack with Diary No3.</li>
			<li>Go back to the elevated walkway and use the teleport to get on the roof.</li>
			<li>Use the teleport at the southwest corner of the roof.</li>
			<li>Go up the stairs, east on the catwalk past the burning roof and crashed helicopter, and up the ladder.</li>
			<li>Continue east and jump over the rail to land on the slanted roof.</li>
			<li>Still going east, move to the air vent (to minimize damage) and drop down.</li>
			<li>Two more teleports puts you at the southeast location.</li>
			<li>Go east and jump on the wall.</li>
			<li>Turn north to walk on top of the wall to the second structure.</li>
			<li>Turn left (west) to find the backpack in between the ribs of the structure.</li>
			<li>Take the next teleport, go east, and then south to the lower roof on the left (east).</li>
			<li>Drop down to the roof and walk on the pipe running east that is joined by two more pipes and turns north.</li>
			<li>At the end before the pipes drop down, sprint-jump to the roof with the satellite dishes.</li>
			<li>Turn left (west) and jump to the pipes running west.</li>
			<li>Where the pipes cross other pipes running north and south, jump to them and follow north.</li>
			<li>When you reach the northeast location, use the right (south) two pipes to reach the backpack.</li>
		</ol>
		<p>At this point, you can use the URT or go back on the pipes and use the last teleport that puts you in Pripyat.</p>

<ul>
	<li><b>Learn about the medicines</b> - Use the Camouflaged Exoskeleton suit to avoid gunfire. See <a href="#UL">Unexplored Land</a> for instructions on getting it. In Cordon, check the road that runs past the Rookie Village to see if there are any BTRs guarding the checkpoint. If not, go to the square two-story building on the west side of the road and up the stairs. Otherwise, you must go along the east fence, over the fallen tree and approach the checkpoint from the south. Collect the medicine and syringes, then go out the way you came in.</li>
	<li><b>Learn about the floppy disk</b> - Accepting this task opens a transition between Gynecologist's cave and the Labyrinth. In Labyrinth, take the left of three passages, left at the first circular passage, and then three rights to get back to the small passage guarded by three Burner anomalies. Throw a bolt to activate the anomalies and go into the passage. Just ahead is a wounded Merc with the disc beside him. Take the disc and go back the way you came. Talk to Gynecologist to complete the task</li>
	<li><b>Reagent Flasks</b> - This task does not appear on your PDA Tasks list, but follows the <i>Learn about the floppy disk</i> task. You get a clue from Cyclops about a tower on a hill and jumping a fence. The tower is in the northwest corner of Army Warehouses, north of the checkpoint. From the road going west past the farmstead, go northwest up the hill and onto the boulders toward the tower on top of the boulders. Continue west over the boulders, staying under the power lines. The next tower has three flasks next to the southeast footer. If not, look downhill as they may have rolled away. You can put the flasks in your artifact container to take back to Gynecologist.</li>
	<li><b>Learn about solutions</b> - This task is one of three that happen simultaneously: the other two being the <i>Kill Sidorovich</i> task from Chimera and the <i>Learn about the controller corpse</i> task from Owl. Find and return the Controller. After you trick Chimera into thinking you killed Sidorovich, Cyclops gives you the flasks location. Go to the southwest corner of the Radar complex and use the structure to the west to get on the roof of the L-shaped building. Find the flasks in the room with the doll. Take the flasks back to Gynecologist to complete the task.</li>

	<li><b>Bring Victor Hologram to Klenov</b> - First, escort Hologram to the Army Warehouses transition in the north. The hardest part is keeping him from stepping on a mine. He stops at the large boulder just before the transition. Talk to him to get the task update. Now go meet him in Warlab and talk to Klenov.</li>

	<li><b>Get the ingredients for Kalmyk: The Night Star artifact and a dried bear paw</b> - At this point in the game, the only place you can find bears is in the Forgotten Forest. Usually, I find two of them east of Cross' camp, about halfway to the Dark Valley transition near a fallen tree. Throw the paw into a Fruit Punch, making sure there is a white flash. Sometimes dropped items fall behind you and you have to pick them up, turn around with your back to the anomaly, and drop it again. Wait two game-time hours and it pops out again. Find, or cook up, and Night Star, and go back to Kalmyk. It takes about 12 game-time hours until you can get the medicine from Kalmyk.</li>

			<li>Use your binoculars to find a Bandit, Tail, running around the area.</li>
			<li>Get down to the ground as fast as possible and follow the Bandit. Jump over the rail to the deck below, go east down a few steps, and cross over to the other boat to jump down to the ground.</li>
			<li>Follow Tail at a distance until he stops near the Dangerous Cave.</li>
			<li>Go talk to him. (This part isn't translated yet) He explains that his friend is trapped in the cave by a boulder that collapsed and blocks the entrance. You tell him to go back to the Skadovsk until you figure something out.</li>
			<li>Go report to Karagoz to complete the task.</li>

Talk with Hologram, then move on to Warlab. In Warlab, use the elevator shafts to go down to the bottom level, switch to the other shaft, and go up to meet with Hologram, Klenov, and then Hologram again to complete the task.</li>
	<li><b>Bring the artifact</b> - Bring 10 Cobblestone artifacts and the Heart of the Poltergeist artifact you got from Miner when you completed the <a href="#Akim">Get 2 flashlights for the Miner</a> task.</li>
	<li><b>Speak with Klenov</b> - You get this task while in Old Village. Go to Pripyat > Radar > Warlab and use the elevator shafts as before to get to Klenov. Talk to him and he gives you the <i>Find the psi-antenna</i> task.</li>
	<li><b>Find the psi-antenna</b> - Pack your rapid-fire Gauss for this one. The antenna sits on top of the death truck where Astrologer found you at the beginning of the game. It's near impossible to sprint in, grab the antenna, and get out again. Try taking out some of the fast-moving mutants, like chimeras, psuedodogs, and bloodsuckers. And any controllers, too. Take the antenna to Klenov to complete the task.</li>
	<li><b>Take photos for Klenov</b> - Be sure to pack two bottles of Antidote before you leave.
		<ol>
			<li>Take the elevator shaft down, switch to the other shaft, and go up to the forth level as you would to leave.</li>
			<li>Instead, continue west past the exit to the doorway leading down some stairs into the room with the hole in the floor.</li>
			<li>At the bottom of the stairs, turn left and follow the catwalk around to the X-16 transition.</li>
			<li>In X-16, go to the control room, put all weapons in your backpack, and use the binoculars to find the target area (usually above the container). If you do not see the target area with your binoculars, check the minimap for a corpse. If you see a blue dot anywhere in the area, reload the autosave and try again. The brain should show on your minimap as an enemy (red dot).</li>
			<li>With the camera pointed at the target area, press the fire button to take the picture. You get a successful message if you did it right.</li>
			<li>Now leave the lab through the underground.</li>
			<li>Outside, go east toward the factory entrance while watching for the target controller. With the controller, you don't get any prompt. It's just a matter of taking a headshot. Again, you get a success message if you did it right.</li>
			<li>The friendly zombie is in the northwestern part of the factory complex, north of the X-16 entrance. He appears on your minimap as neutral. I recommend you clear the area of zombies and mutants (as much as possible) before talking to him.</li>
			<li>Talk to Chernomor and give him the Antidote that he asks for. This converts him into less-zombie-more-stalker and you get the <i>Withdraw Chernomor</i> task.</li>
			<li>Lead Chernomor to the bonfire in the stalker camp (near the bus where you woke up after the blowout while helping Kruglov take measurements.</li>
			<li>Talk to Chernomor about the Dead City teleport and he gives you a cache reward back in the factory complex.</li>
			<li>Go back into the factory complex and the building with the X-16 entrance.</li>
			<li>Go up the stairs to the top floor and out through the doorway on the north side.</li>
			<li>Turn right (east) and go up the ladder to find the backpack containing an Anomalous Walther wa2000 rifle and 7.62 ammo.</li>

<ul>
	<li><b>Help Kolmogor</b> - Follow Kolmogor to the store and clear out the guards. Kolmogor finds his brother dead. Talk to him to complete the task and get the <i>Help capture the headquarters</i> task.</li>
	<li><b>Help capture the headquarters</b> - Leave the store and turn left (north) to go up some stairs. The headquarters is a house east of the stairs. Clear out the guards and enter the house to complete the task.</li>
	<li><b>Find out where Panther is</b> - You get this task along with <i>Help capture the headquarters</i>, but where to look for her comes a bit later. When Panther sends an SMS letting you know she's in the Swamp, you send an SMS to Fang asking for a transition from the Swamp to Old Village. Then, use the URT to go to the northern location (with the train car pictured). This puts you at the Agroprom to Swamps transition. Panther is at the tip of a peninsula on the west side of the map. As you approach Panther you get an SMS from Fang informing you that the transition back to Old Village has moved, but he's not sure where. Talk to Panther about her brothers and then go north to find Swamp Expert. He offers to help you with the transition, but you have to complete the <i>Search the farm in the Swamps</i> task first:
		<ol>
			<li>Continue north and clear the farm of mutants.</li>
			<li>Go inside the boathouse and walk toward the south end along the east wall.</li>
			<li>Drop off into the water and turn to find the submerged backpack.</li>
			<li>Each backpack has items, so continue south out of the boathouse to find the next backpack among the weeds.</li>
			<li>Go around the south end of the dock and to the tree by the picnic table.</li>
			<li>Find the backpack in the bushes near the fence.</li>
		</ol>
		<p>Go back to Swamp Expert and then meet Panther. Swamp Expert goes north, passing on the west side of the farm and stops just before reaching the fence. Talk to him again and he marks the transition on your map. Panther seems to have a hard time keeping up and you may need to go back for her (she stops if she gets too far behind). Go through the transition and spawn in the same location as you did coming from Limansk. Lead Panther to Kolmogor. Wait for her to say something and then speak to Kolmogor to complete the task.</p>
	</li>
	<li><b>Survey the village</b> - Meet Pilgrim back at the store and loop through the village, taking out any Military you come in contact with. After a while you send an SMS to Kolmogor telling him the village is clear and return to the HQ to report directly. This opens the Old Village to Limansk transition.</li>
	<li><b>Protect the village</b> - The Military is on the way by helicopter. One lands on the west side of the house in the northwest part of the village. You have time to get on the roof and prepare your grenade launcher. You may also want to make room in your backpack if you want to collect some items from the fallen. When the captain goes down, Kolmogor sends an SMS about victory. However, there may still be one or two soldiers hiding, so another sweep of the village is recommended. Be sure to get the captain's PDA and give it to Kolmogor.</li>

	</li>
	<li><b>Find and inspect the room behind the secret door in laboratory X-10</b> - Kostya doesn't tell you the first part of the task is to find another cache. This one is in X-10, in the first of three rooms with the large white tank just before you get to the Brain Scorcher. Find the backpack on the floor under the large ventilation unit, just below the louvered panel with a red frame. Use the hint in the PDA to figure out the order of Kostya's numbers. Go back to the locked door near the stairs going up to the next level.</li>
	<li><b>Find the cache in Pripyat</b> - Kostya gives you three of nine possible locations. Each location may contain some loot, but only one has the PDA Kostya is looking for:
		<ul>
			<li><b>In the ruins</b> - This is a bit misleading as it says, "garden" but really means, "kindergarten". At the northwest corner of the kindergarten, look under the large slab with five red bricks on top and find the backpack on the ground.</li>

			<li><b>House of Culture</b> - First of three possible locations: Go in the front door and turn left (west) to find a staircase on the left. Go up until you are stopped by the rubble and turn right (east) to find the backpack on the next set of stairs (about halfway up).</li>
			<li><b>House of Culture</b> - Second three possible locations: Where Doc stands in the basement, use the sofa to find the backpack where the duct meets the north wall.</li>
			<li><b>House of Culture</b> - Third of three possible locations: In the main room with the Monolith idol, use the fallen mural to go up and find the backpack on the catwalk.</li>

	<li><b>Kill Bolt and bring his PDA to Le Havre</b> - Go to the checkpoint north of the village, take out the Mercs, and bring the PDA to Le Havre.</li>
	<li><b>Bring the documents from X-10 to Le Havre</b> - In X-10, find the dead Monolith in the lower level marked on the minimap. Apparently, he became a zombie and had to be put down. When you give the document to La Harve, you get an SMS from Freeman. You must respond before you can ask Yakut about Ghost. Freeman gives you the <a href="#Freeman">Bring Freeman the flashdrive from Bland</a> task.</li>
</ul>
<p>You meet up with Le Havre again in X-8. The information you gain from his documents is found on your PDA's Diary Journal page under <i>Information from Le Havre's Map</i>. Here is a list of caches in order of appearance:</p>
<ol>
	<li><b>Jupiter</b> - The only standing building on the north side of Kopachy Village. Go into the southeast room and search the furnace door.</li>
	<li><b>Eastern Pripyat</b> - Go north of the laundry mat, past the flag poles, to the building made up of four structures. This appears to be a florist shop. Go in the front (northwest) door and jump up on the cabinet in the northeast corner. Low-crouch through the duct to the roof of the back (east) building. Drop in the hole to the ceiling (not to the ground) where you can see (and access) the briefcase along the north wall.</li>
	<li><b>Limansk</b> - </li>
	<li><b>Unexplored Land</b> - From Hermit's camp, follow the path north until it bends to the right (east). Turn west and go toward the target on Le Havre's map. Be aware that the area is inhabited by bears (up to five) and frequently visited by both Monolith and Avengers. The stash box is hidden under a cluster of large boulders (much like the caches in Forgotten Forest).</li>
	<li><b>Jupiter</b> - Near the south side of the Jupiter factory complex, directly south of the door going into the building with the underground entrance, find the rusty duct work near the bus. Find the backpack in the southwest corner by looking through the broken-open part.</li>

	<li><b>Protect the barrier</b> - Report to the outpost commander and help defend against the Monolith attack. For this, I recommend getting inside the bus near the fence for the best cover.</li>
	<li><b>Bring the controller brains to Lukash</b> - Lukash wants the brains of two Controllers from the north side of CNPP, and 300,000 RUs.</li>
	<li><b>Deliver the dynamite to Lukash</b> - This sends you to the Military base in Agroprom. You can run-n-gun your way in, or wait to get the camouflaged exoskeleton from the cache Lukash gives you for the Controller brains. Completing the task opens the transitions between the Freedom base train tunnel and the Mines.</li>

<p>Matvei is Artem's brother. If you spoke with Artem in Garbage hanger, he expressed his concerned about Matvei's disappearance.</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>Find the person who sent the SMS</b> - In the northeast area of Eastern Pripyat, a trader is trapped on the top floor of the Vine Anomaly's north building. You must kill the Chimeras and start up the vine from the west. At the first branch, turn left. Turn left at the next branch and cross over to the vine going up to Matvei's location. Talk to him and get the <i>Help Matvei Kulinar</i> task.</li>
	<li><b>Help Matvei Kulinar</b> - You get this task when you rescue Matvei from the Chimeras at the Vine Anomaly. Go south to the hospital, which is full of zombies and bloodsuckers. Climb to the roof of the round building at the south end of the courtyard to get away from the mutants, and drop down to the lower roof as the mutants can climb the ladder, too. The Matvei's stash is in the east wing, second floor, southeast room. Find the backpack inside the small tank with the door slightly open. Take the items to Matvei to get the next phase of the task, clearing the laundry mat of librarians. Once that's done, Matvei sets up shop on the second floor. Ask if he has any work and he gives the <i>Complete the order for the pistols</i> task. Hopefully, you've been saving weapons and have these two items in your cache.</li>
	<li><b>Complete the order for the pistols</b> - You need a Taurus Raging Bull and Desert Eagle to complete this task. You may already have a Desert Eagle (if you've been stashing at least one of each weapon). You can buy a Taurus Raging Bull from Skinflint for 2224 RUs, or wait until you find one. The reward is a hint on two caches. Check the PDA Diary Journal page for <i>Information from Matvei Kulinar</i>. Here are the cache locations:
	<ol>
		<li>In the Freedom Base, go to the northwest corner and jump your way on top of the electrical transformer. Find the backpack on top of the northeast corner.</li>
		<li>In ATP, go outside the southwest corner of the Bandit base to the chicken coop. In the northeast corner, find the backpack inside the top cage.</li>
	</ol>
	</li>
	<li><b>Find the TOZ-34 and the Uzi</b> - Items you hopefully have. The TOZ-34 is a Bandit favorite, so hitting their bases may help you find one. Uzis are hard to come by, although you may earn one as a task reward. The cache reward locations are:
	<ol>
		<li>The Yantar tunnels - Pass the fiery pipe leak where the tunnel turns to the left. Follow the tunnel until just before the next turn and find the backpack inside the L-shaped pipe.</li>

		<li>Eastern Pripyat bookstore - Go to the northwest corner of the front room with all the bookshelves. Jump on the shelves along the north wall and to the top of the west wall shelves. Find the backpack between ceilings to the northwest of your position. This cache contains a document with information on transitions between Eastern Pripyat and CNPP1.</li>
		<li>Unexplored Land swamp</li>
	</ol>

Go west on top of the garages and drop down behind the last one. Turn to find the backpack on the ground at the southeast corner of the southwest garage.</li>
	</ol>
	</li>
	<li><b>Find the weapons</b> - Three BM-16 sawn-off shotguns and an Iglomet sniper rifle. The shotguns are a favorite of Bandits in the southern maps, like Cordon, Garbage, and Dark Valley.

	<ol>
		<li>Pripyat car - Go to the underground car park and locate the Zaporozhets near the southwest ramp. Find the backpack on the floor under the driver's seat.</li>
		<li>Jupiter Underground - The cache is a little closer to the Jupiter entrance. Either way, the spiders are back.

Low-crouch to find the backpack inside.</li>
	</ol>
	</li>
	<li><b>Find a HK417 and a PPSH-41</b> - This is the last of Matvei's orders. Again, you should have picked each of these up along the way. The reward locations are:
	<ol>
		<li>Sarcophagus hardware cabinets</li>

	<li><b>Get the book for Miner</b> - The Garbage to Forgotten Forest transition puts you in the northeast corner of the map. The nearby boulders hold a stash. Go south and stay near the western edge to avoid mutants. In the southwest corner of the map is a downed helicopter with the book on the east side. Pick up the book and continue south around the boulder for cover as there is a military squad spawns. When the way is clear, another stash can be found to the northeast. Continue northeast and find the stalker camp. Find Cross and ask who he is and why he's in the Forgotten Forest. He tells his story and offers the <a href="Cross">Bring 15 Artifacts to Cross</a> task. These are very common artifacts and you should be able to fill the request without really trying. Plus, the reward is a Simbion artifact that you'll need later. There are several more stashes under boulder formations if you want to search for them. Or wait until you come back with Cross' artifacts. If you go exploring and come across a radio antenna, take note of it's location for later. Then head back to the Cave. Return the book to Miner and ask if there is anything else you can help him with. He then gives you the <i>Free the captive</i> task.</li>

			<li>Turn right at the first campfire, and right again. Stay to the right to take a spiraling passage up to the Labyrinth transition.</li>
			<li>In the Labyrinth, there are two or three Burers waiting just ahead (south). Take them out and follow the passage south. Eventually, you come to northeast corner of a large room with Monolith snipers on ledges, and a few on the ground.</li>
			<li>Turn left and follow the wall to the southwest corner where you see another passage on the left.</li>
			<li>Follow the passage up to the next level. The prisoner is kept on the next level, but you can see him on the minimap and hear him calling for help. But you need to kill the Monolith with the door code first.</li>
			<li>Continue to the center of the level and turn right. Take note of the code-locked door. You will need this in the <a href="#Fima">Find the box and safe</a> task.</li>
			<li>Go over a walkway to the outer ledge and take the passage on the right. It's a long way up to the next level.</li>
			<li>You enter back into the large room and follow the ledge north.</li>
			<li>Continue through another passage that brings you out to the level with the prisoner, Fima Coal.</li>
			<li>If you have the blue book with the six-digit code, open the door and give Fima a med kit. Then talk to him and make your way back to the transition. If you don't have the code yet, keep going. The passage is fairly linear at this point.</li>
			<li>When you spawn in Cave, follow the passage down and stay to the left until the passage turns south. this brings you to the intersection with the campfire where you found Baldy's treasure.</li>
			<li>Take the first right after the campfire and follow the passage back to the ladder with four campfires.</li>
			<li>Follow your path back to the large room and go to the far-right corner.</li>

	<li><b>Retrieve the walkie talkie</b> - This task has a five-minute timer that stops when you find the item. Save the game as soon as the timer starts. This (I suspect) locks the location of the item in case you have trouble finding it. Although, you should be able to check the following locations in less than three minutes. These are the backpacks I've found so far:

		<ol>

			<li>Go north to find the broken out wall and a ladder up.</li>
			<li>Go south under the stairs, drop through the hole (don't use the ladder to save time), and west to find the backpack in the northeast corner.</li>
			<li>If it's empty, go back and up the stairs you just went under. Getting out of the hole can be tricky: climb to the top as far as you can (you will be pushed slightly to the right) and side-step right.</li>
			<li>Go up the ladder in the southwest corner to find the backpack in the southeast corner.</li>
			<li>If it's empty, drop through the floor down two levels and east up the stairs to the entrance.</li>
			<li>Go east to the farthest elevator doors and find the backpack in the slight opening.</li>
			<li>If it's empty, go back to the doorway south of the elevators.</li>
			<li>Follow the passage east and then south to find the backpack on the floor at the far end of the lockers.</li>
			<li>If it's empty, go back out and west through the left doorway and down the steps to the room with the broken out floor.</li>
			<li>Turn left (south) through the doorway and follow the hallway into the room with a large platform.</li>
			<li>Go down the stairs and drop down (don't use the ladder) in the southeast corner.</li>
			<li>Follow the passage to the last room on the left.</li>
			<li>Go to the end, going around the anomaly to find the backpack in the open cage on the north side.</li>

<ul>
	<li><b>Bring the Flash artifact</b> - Ask if there is anything you can help with and he gives you this task. Flash artifacts are pretty easy to come by, and you probably have one hanging on your belt already. The artifact is most commonly found in the moving Electro anomalies of the Cordon tunnel and the Agroprom Underground.</li>
	<li><b>Find Petrenko's flask</b> - Ask if there is any work and Petrenko sends you to Lanky, the technician at the Bar. You must give Garik a candy bar to get past him, and then step back so he can move away from the door.Lanky wants 10 circuit boards, five Wrenched artifacts, and some money. The circuit boards are in the Cordon Military Outpost outhouse in the southeast corner of the complex. The artifacts are hard to come by and may take you well into the game to get. When you have everything, go to Lanky and find that he doesn't have the flask and sends you to Prapor. If you have 10 Scientific medkits, take them with you for an easy trade with <a href="#Prapor">Prapor</a>. Prapor sends you to look in the garbage heaps for the guy Lanky described. Go to the east end of the east pile and find the ladder into the pile. Make your way down to find a dead Uncle Vasya. Take the flask back to Petrenko.</li>

<p>This series of collection tasks starts by talking to Fox, "Hello, Fox, how are you?". Prapor is the Warrant Officer at the Garbage's north Duty Outpost.</p>
<ol>
	<li>After returning to Garbage from Agroprom and helping Duty fight off the Boar attack, talk to the Warrant Officer at the gate to the Bar, "Hello, Prapor, I have come for business..." In response, Prapor asks for Bloodsucker tentacles. </li>
	<li>Ask Prapor, "Can I get you anything?" and he asks for four Flesh eyes. He also gives you two backpacks and five F1 grenades.</li>
	<li>Bring Prapor the Flesh eyes, ask him how he's feeling, and he asks for three sets of Bloodsucker tentacles.</li>
	<li>Bring Prapor the Bloodsucker tentacles, ask him how he's feeling, and he asks for five pseudodog tails. This is the last thing Prapor asks for.</li>
	<li><b>Get 10 scientific kits for Prapor</b> - Ask, "Hey Prapor, how's the service life?" and he tells you about a PDA he will give you for 10 medkits.

	<li><b>Find Ghost's PDA</b> - In Lab X-16, when you get to the room with Ghost's body and the controller, clear the room and get Ghost's stuff. Then, go to the first cage by the door and across from the lavatory. On the equipment rack in the southeast corner you can just see the PDA. When you pick it up, two Burers spawn, so be ready for that. Give Sakharov the PDA and ask him about Fang's death. Then, talk to Kruglov and get <a href="#Kruglov">Bring Ghost's Diary to the Scientist</a>.</li>
	<li><b>Find the "Elder Glassbeads" artifact for Sakharov</b> - This opens the Agroprom to Yantar transition. Sakharov sends you to the military base for documents about the Yantar to Agroprom transition.</li>
	<li><b>Collect scientific books</b> - Three books in three different labs.
		<ol>
			<li>Since you're in Yantar when you get this task, it makes sense to do it now. Plus, you can do the <a href="#Kruglov">Return the missing decoder</a> at the same time.</li>
			<li>In X-16, go down the elevator shaft and through the next room.</li>
			<li>Down the hallway and past the steaming overhead pipe.</li>

	<li><b>Meet with Professor Sakharov</b> - Tell Sakharov that you got his SMS and he gives you the <i>Find the courier in Radar</i> task.</li>
	<li><b>Find the courier in Radar</b> - In Radar, go to the tunnel leading to X-10 and find the wounded courier. Before talking to the courier, make sure you have some anti-radiation artifacts on your belt. Talk to the courier, who then dies when you finish the conversation. Because of the radioactive effects, you can only sprint a few steps at a time. Take the radioactive case back to Sakharov to complete the task.</li>
	<li><b>Return to the bar in Zaton</b> - From Yantar, you can go Radar > Red Forest > Limansk > Dead City > Zaton. Go to the Skadovsk and talk to Karagoz to complete the task.</li>

	<li><b>Find the military survivor</b> - The <a href="#Karagoz">Detect the thief</a> task gives you a hint as to the survivor's location, which is the Dangerous Cave. The task is completed by entering the cave, which is blocked by a boulder that can only be moved, (or should I say, removed) using the following procedure:
		<ol>
			<li>Activate the Capsule for the Burner anomaly on the right side of the boulder and step back.</li>
			<li>After the anomaly has had a chance to burn a few seconds, get as close to the anomaly as possible without taking damage and drop the Compass Isomorph. There is a white flash and the Burner anomaly is gone.</li>
			<li>Pick up the Compass Isomorph and step back again.</li>
			<li>Drop the Droplets artifact and use the Gravity Gun to shoot it into the boulder near, or left of center. You need access to the right side, so keep the Droplets away from there.</li>
			<li>Activate the Capsule for the Snow anomaly at the same location as the Burner and step back.</li>
			<li>After the anomaly has had a chance to snow for a few seconds, get as close to the anomaly as possible without taking damage and drop the Compass Isomorph. There is a white flash and the Snow anomaly is gone.</li>
			<li>Pick up the Compass Isomorph and step back one more time.</li>
			<li>Use the Gravity Gun to shoot the Slime artifact into the boulder. The boulder breaks apart.</li>

<ul>
	<li><b>Bring the unusual controller brain to Sviblov</b> - The controller is located at the cabin in the northwest corner of the map, along with another controller and a few civilian zombies. Stay to the west of the area and come up to the southwest corner of the boat house to shoot the controller standing in the opening at the north end. Move around the west side of the boat house, grab the controller's brain and head back the way you came.</li>
	<li><b>Obtain a rifle for Sviblov</b>:

			<li>If you didn't alert the Bandits, move along the south wall, under the shelves and as close to the backpack on the floor as possible.</li>
			<li>Get the rifle. If you don't alert the Bandits, this spawns a group of Hunters who eliminate the Bandits. However, if they see you, the Hunters don't spawn.</li>
			<li>Talk to Dan, the leader. Ask him what he's worried about and he mentions a stalker named <a href="#Cat">Cat</a>. Ask Dan if he has any work and he sends you to Arhara, just the guy we need for Kruglov's computer. See <a href="#ClearSky">Get an Unusual Parcel for Dan</a> for instructions.</li>
		</ol>
	</li>
	<li><b>Find Freebie</b> - If you have a fairly accurate rifle, like my personal favorite - SIG SG-550, approach the Village Ruins from the south. There's a round cement chunk you can use for cover and pick the Mercs off as they come at you. Once the village is clear (you get a task update), find Freebie and his companion in the root cellar.

<ul>
	<li><b>Bring the toolbox to Sid</b> - Take the artifact container to Sidorovich and say, <i>Hey, Sid, you look like shit! You need to lay off the vodka for awhile.</i> to get the metal box. This task gives you the door code opposite the road to Pripyat in Radar. On your PDA, go to Diary > Journal > Door Codes.

<p>Vasily is the Clear Sky repair technician, and a member of the Traders. He is also Sidorovich's brother and you/Marked One mistake him for Sid. Go to what was Novikov's hut and ask him what he is doing in the Swamp. He gives you the <i>Get 3 cans of Kalmyk Ointment for Vasily</i> task. Go to the Pump Station, look inside the backpack on the floor, and take the grenade. This is your introduction to Kalmyk, who gives you the <i>Obtain for Kalmyk his container</i> task. The container is west of the Pump Station near the west end of an island (just east of the tall grass). The trick to this task is to find the right direction to approach the container without getting transported back to the east end of the island. You need to systematically approach the container from a random direction, and moving either left or right about 10 steps (or points of the compass) and trying it again. Keep moving in the same direction until you find the window in the anomaly.</p>

<p>Before returning to Kalmyk, continue north to the area with the controller. See <a href="#Sviblov">Bring the unusual controller brain to Sviblov</a>. Once you have the brain, head back to the Pump Station. Give Kalmyk the container and buy three bottles of ointment (you have to ask three times) using either cigarettes or vodka.

<p>You can talk to Voronin after you complete the <i>Bring the unusual artifact to Plichko</i> task, which is part of <a href="#Baldy">Search for the treasure</a>. Voronin offers the following tasks:</p>
<ol>
	<li><b>Repel the attack and kill Hump</b> - Ask him why he isn't the good life and Voronin gives you this task. You have to be the one to kill Hump to get credit for the task. As soon as Voronin gives you the task, sprint to the checkpoint before another stalker kills Hump, who is one of the few wearing an exoskeleton. You may be able to pick up an AEK-971 from the attackers. This weapon is required for another task.</li>
	<li><b>Take the RG-6 from the Freedom base</b> - Same as the vanilla game with a twist - the cellar is mined. So, you must jump off the ladder to the left and circle around the outside of the cellar to get the weapon. Then, sprint-jump to the ladder and climb out. Sometimes, the condition of the weapon is too poor and you have to actually steal the other one out of Freedom's weapon stash.</li>
	<li><b>Find the thermoses</b> - After repelling the attack, ask if there is anything you can help with to get this task. Voronin sends you to Garik, the security guard in the Bar. Talk to Garik and he asks for money and 10 packs of cigarettes. There are five thermoses in the Northern Farmstead house (top shelf on the east wall) and five in the Pripyat Hotel (last room on the right, second floor). These are covered in the walkthrough.</li>
	<li><b>Bring the camouflaged exoskeleton</b>
		<ol>
			<li>Clear the Bandit base in ATP and find the build with the Monolith sign on it.</li>
			<li>Climb the ladder on the south side and get on top of the ledge near the chimney.</li>
			<li>Jump to the ledge of the chimney and onto the roof.</li>
			<li>Go east to find a hole in the roof and drop down.</li>
			<li>Go north to find the suit.</li>
			<li>Turn the suit in to Voronin and he tells you of an informant (Snitch) a the Bar. You can also get the <i>Get the sniper rifle from the Mercs</i> task.</li>
		</ol>
	</li>
	<li><b>Find the documents</b> - Voronin says there are some documents somewhere in the Dark Valley factory complex. Check the corpse on the ledge of the smoke stack.</li>
	<li><b>Get the sniper rifle from the Mercs</b> - This task is from the vanilla version, but with a twist. You have to take <a href="#Lukash">Follow the informant</a> task to find the rifle.</li>
	<li><b>Exchange artifact</b> - After returning the camouflaged exoskeleton suit, ask Voronin if he has another job. He sends you to Sakharov with an artifact, who in turn gives you </li>
	<li><b>Find the computer and the video transmitter</b> - You can get the computer without killing every Bandit in the base. Of course, if you want to, be my guest. Otherwise:
		<ol>
			<li>Go in through either the drain tile or front gate and get to the pit by the front gate.</li>
			<li>Follow the tunnel to the ladder and go up.</li>
			<li>Take the stairs to the top and fight your way to the next stairs (south).</li>
			<li>Go up another level and turn left (north).</li>
			<li>Continue north until you're outside again (you may have to take out the tower snipers).</li>
			<li>Turn left (west) and drop to the next roof.</li>
			<li>Turn left again to find the window with a board over it and a wooden box on a metal frame.</li>
			<li>Shoot the board to get it out of the way and jump to the box.</li>
			<li>Low-crouch through the window and pick up the book and transmitter at the south end of the room.</li>
			<li>Go back the stairs, down two levels, and out the front of the building.</li>
		</ol>
		<p>Now for the video transmitter in Army Warehouses. Check your map to see if you have a transition at the northeast end of Dark Valley that goes to Radar. This might be a shorter way to go. In Army Warehouses, go to Bloodsucker Village and to the white house on the north edge. Find the video transmitter on the floor of the southeast room. Be ready for the Military squad that spawns in the house to the east. Take the equipment back to Voronin. This is the last task from him for a while.</p>
	</li>
	<li><b>Help the Dutiers in Eastern Pripyat</b> - Use the Pripyat to Eastern Pripyat transition on the eastern side of Pripyat, south of the underground car park. Report to Plichko and agree to help attack the Sports Complex. You must keep Plichko alive during this attack in order to complete the task. And save your Gauss batteries for later. Head north through the buildings and find some cover to snipe the Monoliths in the windows. Keep in mind that another Duty group is coming in from the north. After a few kills, get inside the building and clear each floor. When the last Monolith is down, you get a task update to report to Plichko. However, there is a possible bug where Plichko may tell you to "get moving". Check your task list for the <i>Find the person who sent the SMS</i> task. If you don't have it listed, patrol the area until the message comes in. You may need to leave the map and return.

Sometimes, the Bandits all spawn in one place north of the cabin and you can take most of them out with a grenade launcher. Other times they come at you from north, east, and west.In that case, use the tractor for cover and go east to west with your sniper rifle. When it's clear, talk to Sepator again, take the backpack out of the cabin, and turn it over to Zahar.</li>
	<li><b>Destroy the Merc camp at Rostok</b> - There is a group of Mercs just past the transition who attack any Dutiers. Take the Mercs out and report back to Zahar.</li>
