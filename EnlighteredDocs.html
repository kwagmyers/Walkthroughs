<h2>Enlightered/Secret Documents</h2>
<p>The Secret Documents (Enlightered Documents in previous versions) are listed on the Diary page of your PDA and, when all are collected, unlock alternative endings to the game. The names and locations of these documents are based on Lost Alpha version 1.4007 Developer's Cut (build 7246) with default setup (at installation), played at Master level, and includes references to main tasks, as well as optional tasks unique to the mod (as far as I know).</p>

<h2>Listed in order of appearance according to the <a href="LostAlpha.html" target="_blank">Storyline Walkthrough</a></h2> 
<ul>
   <li>Part 3. Agroprom documents - Results in completing the <a href="LAOT.html#Find-the-documents" target="_blank">Find the documents (Agroprom)</a> optional task.</li>
   <li>Part 2. Experiments with benetic sequences - Download the Reports.txt file from the PC near <i>LX18 document #4</i> in <a href="LostAlpha.html#Lab-X18" target="_blank">Lab X18</a>. Password is <b>top_secret</b>.</li>
   <li>Part 1. Transfer confirmation - Download the Transactions.txt file from the PC near <i>Wormholes - Karl D.</i> document #1 in <a href="LostAlpha.html#Lab-X18" target="_blank">Lab X18</a>.</li>
   <li>Part 4. Mine territory documents - Results in completing the <a href="LAOT.html#Find-the-documents-(Forest)" target="_blank">Find the documents (Forest)</a> optional task and telling Petrenko, "I want to discuss the docs."</li>
   <li>Part 10. Private message - Pick up the PDA on the same desk as the documents of the <a href="#Find-the-documents-for-Sin">Find the documents for Sin</a> optional task in Lab X-14.</li>
   <li>Part 5. Yantar documents - Results in completing the <a href="LAOT.html#Find-the-documents-(Yantar)">Find the documents (Yantar)</a> task.</li>
   <li>Part 14. Generators location plan - While you're in Lake Yantar, go south to the Construction Site move point. When you spawn in the Construction Site, continue south, turn east onto the road that runs along the south of the map, and take it to the end. To the right of the green gate there is an opening in the wall through which you can find a red Kamaz truck with the driver's door slightly open. The document is laying on the seat, which you can also get to by standing on the front bumper.</li>
   <li>Part 11. Letter to N.A. Ivanov - After you have <a href="LostAlpha.html#Clearing-Radar" target="_blank">Cleared Radar</a>, or at least the southern checkpoints, take the Old Road move point. As soon as you spawn in Old Road, drive past the bus, stop, get out and climb up on the hood of the bus. A squad of about eight Monolith are right behind you. Wait for them to get through the gate and open fire. Then, sprint up the drive to the complex on the east side of the road and use the fuel truck as cover to take out as many Monolith guards as possible, another eight in all. Be aware that they don't all joint the fight and it's very possible to run into one or two as you move around the complex. When the front area is clear, move inside the gate and to the north end of the building. Climb the ladder up to the catwalk and walk south on the pipes until you get to an opening in the railing near a ladder up to the roof. Go up the ladder and then north to drop down into the room below. The document is on the southeast corner of the machine you land on. For some reason, you get two updates, <i>Found information</i> and <i>Item lost</i>.</li>
   <li>Part 7. Project of the "Monolith" hologram - After you turn off the device during the <a href="LostAlpha.html#Disable-Earthquake-Doomsday-Device" target="_blank">Disable Earthquake Doomsday Device</a> task, retrace your steps until you come to the long hallway facing north with a workbench just ahead on the right with two electrical devices on it. On the left, just past the bench, are some steps up and a partially open door. As you enter, a cut-scene about the development of the security hologram plays. When it's done, go over to the PC, press action, and download the override_locks.txt file.</li>
   <li>Part 8. Access to the NSA's Intellipedia - After you turn off the device during the <a href="LostAlpha.html#Disable-Earthquake-Doomsday-Device" target="_blank">Disable Earthquake Doomsday Device</a> task and downloading <i>Part 7. Project of the "Monolith" hologram</i>, return to the first hallway, where you pasted the hologram on your way to turn of the Doomsday Device. As you pass two unarmed Zombies, they wake up so you need to put them back to sleep...for good. When you reach the hallway, turn left and go up the steps, then into the door on the right where a swirling white cloud circles on the floor. Entering the room triggers a cut-scene with two scientists talking about plate tectonics. When it's done, go to the PC, press action, and download the nsa.txt file.</li>
   <li>Generator Notes (not numbered). This document is located in the Sarcophagus. Either before or after retrieving the battery pack in the <a href="#Restore-power-in-the-control-room">Restore power in the control room</a> task, detour left (south) at the top of the stairs and open the first door on the right. Enter the room and go through the doorway on the right (north) to trigger a cut-scene. When it's done, continue north to the second desk on the right and pick up the <i>Scientist's Notes</i>.</li>
   <li>Part 13. Report to N.A. Fyodorov - In Pripyat, there is a controller wondering around north of the bus station. Looking at the map, there are three buildings together (south to north) facing the square. This is a good place to start looking for the controller. Kill it, then loot the body to get the document.</li>
   <li>Part 12. Letter to MOS-1 - After you <a href="#Find-door-switch">Find door switch</a>, turn west and go in the room with the green tile on the walls. Then turn north, through the room with white tile, through the northwest doorway, and to the end. The document is on top of the table in the northwest corner of this room.</li>
   <li>Part 9. Further Instructions - From the same computer terminal that you download the <i>Privileges</i> file of the <a href="#Find-a-way-to-disable-the-lock-down">Find a way to disable the lock down</a> task, download the <i>Mailbox</i> file.</li>
</ul>
