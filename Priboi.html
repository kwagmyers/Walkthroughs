<h1>Priboi Story</h1>

<p>Last Revision: February 2021</p>

<p><a href="index.html">Home</a></p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>This guide is based on Priboi Story Overhaul 2020, version 1.000x, with default setup (at installation) and added key bindings in the following list. Played at Master level.</p>

<p>Keybindings added to the user.ltx file (syntax in <i>italic</i>).</p>

<ul>
	<li>Start/stop vehicle engine - <i>bind turn_engine kNUMPAD0</i> (The Mod'ers suggest using the B key, but I'm use to using the number pad zero key after playing <a href="ogse.html" target="_blank">O.G.S.E.</a></li>
	<li>Standard view - <i>bind cam_1 kF1</i></li>
	<li>Third-person view - <i>bind cam_2 kF2</i></li>
	<li>Another Third-person view - <i>bind cam_3 kF3</i></li>
</ul>

<p>Lieutenant Priboi Slipehenko is a character introduced near the end of the mod, <a href="OblivionLost.html" target="_blank">Oblivion Lost</a>. This mod assumes the character and is set one year later. The military is no longer at odds with Loners and Duty, and blowouts often cause dead mutants to wake up again. Priboi's mission is to collect information on a group known as UHSF.</p>

<h2>Tips</h2>

<ul>
	<li>It's very important to follow the storyline and aquire the documents in order. You can break the storyline and never be able to finish if you get the documents out of order.</li>
	<li>Most elements added by the mod'ers are not recognised by non-player characters (NPCs) and mutants. They can see you and shoot/bite/claw you even when hiding behind a tree or building.</li>
	<li>Some of the documents and other items are stored in your inventory, while others are download into the Encyclopedia of your PDA.</li>
	<li>With the exception of 7.62x39mm, there's plenty of ammo for your favorite primary and secondary weapon. This allows you to pack light on the ammo, but keep a variety of guns with you.</li>
	<li>When a Psydogiant gets ready to stomp, get ready to jump. If you're in the air you won't take any damage from the shockwaves.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="sid1">Letter from Sidorovich (1 of 2)</h2>

<p>You start the game with the task of talking to three people. While completing this task, all Stalkers know to look for loot, which you might find in the regular places, along with some additions. When you talk with the commander, you must ask how to earn some money and accept the <i>Bring 20 bottles of vodka</i> task. You cannot leave the Cordon until you give him his vodka, and it might take you two or three days to do it. Also, the on-screen messages are available on your PDA in case you don't finish reading them before they close. Go to Encyclopedia > Training to read the <i>Welcome</i> and <i>Your Training</i> entries.</p>

<p>In the Rookie Village, Buddy tells you there's a letter in the stash box of Sidorovich's bunker, which tells you to find a coffer in the boarded up house. The coffer is the <i>Outpost documents to Priboi</i>. Talk to all three people listed on your PDA to complete the task and get the <i>Find the lost UHSF Documents</i> task with the <a href="#blueprints">Find the CNPP Blueprints</a> step. The steps of this task will update as you aquire each document. Click on the map/text toggle of the task (on your PDA) to get a hint that sends you to the Bar.</p>

<div><b>NOTE:</b> The <i>Bring 20 bottles of vodka</i> task can be very frustrating because it slows the game down and you can't leave Cordon until it's completed. Besides stashes and dead Bandits, you can buy vodka off of some Loners. Nimble is a trader in one of the root cellars and will have one bottle each time you leave the Rookie Village. However, he charges more than the others and money is tight. Also, Bandits respawn in the Vehicle station about once a day (I haven't quite figured out the timing exactly). Be sure to check the stash box there when they do.</div>

<h2 id="coffer">Outpost documents to Priboi</h2>

<p>From Sidorovich's bunker, go to the second house on the right (south) and use your knife to break the boards. Go straight to the back of the house and into the room on the left to find a stash box with the coffer. This tells you to look around and talk to people.</p>

<h2 id="agent">Military Agent's Flash drive</h2>

<p>Once you complete the <i>Bring 20 bottles of vodka</i> task and can leave the Cordon, you get a message when you spawn in Garbage about a military agent and the location is marked on your PDA. Once you clear the area of Bandits, you must work your way through a maze of Vortex anomalies to the back of the tunnel. Here's the walkthrough:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Start on the right (north) side of the tunnel and move along the side of the train engine.</li>
	<li>At the front corner of the engine, look straight down between the two tracks (west) and throw a bolt to find the anomaly in front of you.</li>
	<li>Walk as close to the anomaly as you can without triggering it and turn right 45&#176; (northwest).</li>
	<li>Throw a bolt to find a safe passage between the anomalies and move to the north wall of the tunnel.</li>
	<li>Stay against the wall to the next anomaly and move southwest to the third rail. Not too far or you'll pick up some heavy radiation.</li>
	<li>Move down the rail a few steps to get past the anomaly on the right.</li>
	<li>Move along the second rail (from the north wall) a few steps to get around the anomaly on the left.</li>
	<li>Turn left toward the south wall. You should be able to move safely along the south wall to the agent's body.</li>
</ol>

<p>Loot the agent's corpse, head back through the maze, and on to the Bar.</p>

<h2 id="sid2">Letter from Sidorovich (2 of 2)</h2>

<p>This document is in the back room of the Bar. Facing Barkeep, a.k.a., Don Reba, turn right and follow the passage left and then right again to find the safe. This is a good place to store extra supplies. Next, find the <i>NPP blueprints</i>.</p>

<h2 id="blueprints">NPP Blueprints</h2>

<p>If you are familiar with the <i>Switchboard with a secret stash</i>, you know where this is. If not, here's a walkthrough:</p>

<ol>
	<li>From the Bar, follow the paver walkway to the garage and out the door so that you face north toward the Arena.</li>
	<li>Turn right (east) and follow the road to the left.</li>
	<li>When you get to the Duty checkpoint, turn right and climb the ladder to the catwalk.</li>
	<li>Follow the catwalk around to the right and climb the next ladder to the top of the tower.</li>
	<li>Jump from the tower to the roof and move south to a hole you can drop down into the building.</li>
	<li>Turn north toward the Duty checkpoint and move to the north wall.</li>
	<li>Turn left to find the switchboard on the west wall and get the document. The <i>Find the lost UHSF Documents</i> task updates with the <a href="#UHSF2">Find the lost UHSF Documents #2</a> step, sending you to Agroprom.</li>
	<li>Turn east and walk into the container blocking the gate. Repeat this until the container is clear of the gate.</li>
	<li>Open the gate to leave the building.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="acc1">NPP Accident #1</h2>

<p>When you spawn in Agroprom you get a task to eliminate the Mercs, which are based in the factory complex. Before you head there, step into the train tunnel and work your way through another anomaly maze to the pipe stash in the back. If you start on the left (north) wall of the tunnel, there's only one anomaly that you have to work around. When you come to it, move to the center of the tunnel, walk a few steps, and then throw bolts to find a safe passage back to the wall. Continue to the back of the tunnel and check the pipe stash to find the <i>NPP Accident #1</i> document.</p>

<h2 id="new">X18 Lab New Code</h2>

<p>This document is in a stash box in Strelok's Hideout. Use the same entry as in the vanilla game. There's no need to continue through the underground to the Agroprom Research Institute. It's easier to enter from the hole in the south wall to get the <i>UHSF Documents #2</i>. You can exit the underground the same way that you came in.</p>

<h2 id="UHSF2">UHSF Documents #2</h2>

<p>These documents are on the third floor, same as the <i>Military Documents</i> of the vanilla game. Enter through the hole in the south wall and go in through the window with the spool under it. You also have to kill the leader of the Mercenaries somewhere in the building. His location is on your map. The <i>Find the lost UHSF Documents</i> task updates with the <a href="#dc2">Find the Dead City Documents #2</a> step somewhere in Dark Valley's Lab X18.</p>

<h2 id="dc1">Dead City Documents #1</h2>

<p>The <i>Dead City Documents #1</i> are in Borov's stash box and you have to clear out the Bandit Base to get to it, just as you would in the vanilla game. In Priboi's description of the document, he decides to go to Army Warehouses to catch up with Sidorovich. But before you can go there, you must have the X-Virus vaccine found in the Bandit Base store room.</p>

<h2 id="gen">prof. Kruglov - Genetics</h2>

<p>This document is also in the Bandit Base. Go to the top floor using the stairs in the front of the building. Here's the walkthrough:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Assuming you just aquired <i>Dead City Documents #1</i>, return to the stairs in the front of the building and go to the top floor.</li>
	<li>Turn left (north) and go through two doorways.</li>
	<li>Turn left (west) again, go through the first doorway, and turn right.</li>
	<li>Go through the last doorway to the roof.</li>
	<li>Turn left and drop down to the roof of the connecting walkway.</li>
	<li>Go about halfway and turn left to find a window on the back of the main building with a wooden box on a ledge.</li>
	<li>Put all of your radiation-reducing artifacts on your belt and move to the ledge of the roof.</li>
	<li>Jump to the wooden box, which may fall, but if you land on the ledge you can still access the document.</li>
	<li>Use your knife to break the boards covering the window and low-crouch-jump through the window.</li>
	<li>The stash box on the far end of the room has <i>prof. Kruglov - Genetics</i> document.</li>
	<li>By now, you are probably picking up radiation, so go out the way you came in.</li>
</ol>

<p>The document mentions both Labs X-18 and X-16, so once you are done in Dark Valley, you need to head for Yantar.</p>

<h2 id="dc2">Documents from Dead City #2</h2>

<p>When you spawn in Lab X-18, go around the right side of the elevator to find a backpack on the floor behind some lockers. This has some information about Doc and Silo, but nothing useful. Continue on down the steps where there are several snorks and plenty of loot. From the bottom of the stairs, turn left, left again, through a doorway and left one more time. Put your radiation-reducing artifacts on your belt and go down the steps of the fenced-in area to get <i>Doc's flash drive</i>. This refers to Kruglov and, like <i>prof. Kruglov - Genetics</i>, suggests going to Yantar for more information from Kruglov. The <i>Find the lost UHSF Documents</i> task updates with the <a href="#UHSF1">Find the UHSF Documents #1</a> step in Pripyat.</p>

<h2 id="mutants">Mutations Report #1</h2>

<p>You can get this document either before or after you visit Lab X-18. But you must get it before leaving Dark Valley. If you come back for it later, there's a bug that deletes some of the items you aquire afterward.</p>

<p>There is now a village southeast of the factory, filled with Bandits, zombies, and mutants. You don't need to go into the village, but to the house at the northeast end of it. Going south on the road, turn left (east) immediately after the bridge and follow the edge of the swamp until you see two boulders. Go on the right side of the boulders to the house furthest from the road. This house has a stash box with the <i>Mutations report #1</i>. Possible bug, I had trouble with my car blowing up if I parked too close to the house. So I had to park by the boulders.</p>

<h2 id="p4a">PDA P4a Sensor</h2>

<div><b>NOTE:</b> If you take the <i>Find the family rifle</i> task, you get an update when you pick up the rifle. However, you won't be able to give it to Hunter until you have the Goldfish artifact, which you may not see for a while. You can use the safe at the Bar to store the rifle until them.</div>

<p>The <I>prof. Kruglov - Genetics</i> mentions Lab X-16, so off to Yantar to see what you can find there. As you make your way through the tunnel with the Heat anomalies, you should be greeted by a group of zombies. One of them has the <i>Safe in the house</i> stash with a Seva suit. I recommend this suit for this mod. It holds up well and the night vision is the best of all the suits I've tried.</p>

<p>In Yantar, talk to Professor Panov and learn that Kruglov went into Lab X-16 and never came out. Getting to the lab means fighting through the usual zombies, snorks, and maybe a controller. There's more in the lab, with a burer or two. Kruglov's body is at the bottom of the large, circular (psy-emmitter, or Miracle Machine) room. The ladder down to the bottom is on the other side of the platform as you go down the steps into the circular room. You may be able to get to Kruglov and back again without taking any fire. But you have to fight your way to the top to exit the lab.</p>

<div><b>NOTE:</b> I have had some trouble with saves crashing in Lab X-16. It seems that any save past the first room from the elevator shaft may be corrupted. I've even gone to the extent of running back to that room to save while fighting the zombies in the large circular room.</div>

<p>Kruglov has a PDA P4a Sensor containg UHSF information and a numeric code that is available in the Encyclopedia of your PDA under Access Codes. Put the sensor on your belt to replace the <i>Simple Anomaly Detector</i> that you got at the beginning of the game. This is the only item to collect, so exit the lab through the tunnels and head back to the Bar.</p>

<h2 id="ghost">Ghost Memo from 2009</h2>

<p>When you spawn in Army Warehouses you get the <i>Examine the crash site</i> task that is described in <a href="#convoy">Convoy Report</a>. If you follow the walkthrough in order, you'll get to this after picking up some documents along the way.</p>

<p>Put your anti-rad artifacts on and go north from the Rostok/Army Warehouses transition point, over the hill to the Bloodsucker Village. Continue north past the cement-block ruins at the south end of the village to the house with a boarded-up door. A Bloodsucker comes to greet you, but gets stuck at the door. Kill it and use your knife to break the boards. The first room on the right has a pallet with a barrel on it. Push the barrel out of the way, or stand in another room and blow it up. Then, push the pallet out of the way to access the cellar. I find the easiest way to move the pallet is to push the corner nearest the center of the room toward the south wall. This gives you some space to get between the the east edge of the pallet and wall to push west. After a few pushes, you should be able to access the cellar.</p>

<p>The document is in a stash box, but don't stop to read it until you're out of the cellar because you'll pick up some radiation while down there. Ghost mentions Lab X-10 and Strelok having a key to the WarLab. Remember, you're suppose to kill Strelok (Encyclopedia > Training > Your Assignment), so chances are that you'll run into him and be able to get this key.</p>

<h2 id="sidmemo">Sidorovich Memo</h2>

<div><b>WARNING:</b> You must have the X-Virus vaccine before taking this document. You should have picked it up at the Bandit Base during the <a href="#dc1">Dead City Documents #1</a> task.</div>

<p>Assuming you just aquired the <i>Ghost memo from 2009</i>, go northeast to the next house with a boarded-up door and Bloodsucker. Kill the Bloodsucker, knock out the boards, and access the cellar from the first room on the left. When you take the document from Sidorovich's corpse, a timer starts and you get a warning to use the antidote immediately, which is the X-Virus vaccine. The memo doesn't give you much information, just that the Bandits have the vaccine.</p>

<h2 id="convoy">Convoy Report</h2>

<p>This item is located on one of the military corpses at the crashed helicopter and completes the <i>Examine the crash site</i> task when you get it. The document has one of the missing code numbers in <a href="#gen">prof. Kruglov - Genetics</a>. This gives gives you the <i>Rescue the scientists</i> task.</p>

<h2 id="secret">KGB Secret F24</h2>

<p>Start by going to the Duty leader in the farmstead southeast of the Rostok/Army Warehouses transition point and accepting the <i>Kill the tower sniper</i> task. Completing this gives you the opportunity to accept the <i>Kill Dezik</i> task, which is another target mentioned in Encyclopedia > Training > Your Assignment. This also gives you an opportunity to kill Strelok and Doc.</p>

<p>While you're waiting for the Duty squad to assemble, run up to the wall of the base to check for someone shooting through the brick section of the wall (probably Strelok). If someone is there, toss a grenade over the wall to take him out before Duty shows up and gets wiped out by this guy. Help Duty raid the Freedom Base and get <i>Dezik's key</i> off of Strelok and . When Duty blows a hole in the wall, you have to take out the two snipers in the towers, one by the front gate and the other in the center of the base. You can continue taking out Freedom fighters from your vantage point on the hill to help Duty take the base. And, if you see a guy in a brown trench coat, that's Doc.</p>

<p>Dezik is in the main building with some other guys that you have to take out. Once all the Freedom fighters are all down, you can shoot the lock off the storage room on the first floor and examine the stash box on the north wall to get the <i>KGB Secret F24</i> document. Check Dezik's corpse for <i>Dezik Lohnar's PDA</i>, which has another numeric code that is available in the Encyclopedia of your PDA under Access Codes.</p>

<div><b>NOTE:</b> If you get back to the farmstead and no one is there, it means that none of the Duty guys survived the attack. This means that you cannot complete the <i>Kill Dezik</i> task and it stays on your PDA. You can go back to the base and check for a wounded Duty guy, go back to the last save before the attack and do it over again, or just leave it.</div>

<h2 id="siro">Siro's flash drive</h2>

<p>Contrary to the documents found so far, Siro is right here in Army Warehouses. He's a zombie living in the elevated cabin north of the base. Kill him and take his flash drive, which tells you of some papers that Siro hid in Lab X-10. So, off to Radar/Red Forest.</p>

<h2 id="scientists">Scientist's flash drive</h2>

<p>Since Freedom is an advisary and they control the Barrier, you can either fight your way past them, or try to slip past them starting from the chopper crash site. Go northeast up the hill to the large boulder where the fence starts. Sprint down the hill along the fence and around the end to get behind a boulder without getting shot. When you get to the first checkpoint, the military may be in control, but proceed with caution. The bend in the road, however, still belongs to Monolith (as it did in the vanilla version). You have two options once you get past this squad: continue on the road and fight your way to the road to Pripyat, or go off-road west to the crash site. Either way, search the scientist's corpse furthest from the road (in the orange suit) to get the flash drive. You must also get within a few yards/meters to get credit for searching the crash site to complete the task.</p>

<div><b>NOTE:</b> At the intersection to the road that goes to Pripyat, Duty and Freedom are having a stare down until you open fire. Then they start shooting each other and at you. Be sure not to hit any of your Duty buddies.</div>

<h2 id="x182">X18 Lab Code #2</h2>

<p>Southwest of the intersection to the road that goes to Pripyat, there is a Monolith sniper up on a raised platform near a locked door. Once the area is clear (see the preceding note), use the partial numeric code from <i>prof. Kruglov - Genetics</i>, along with the missing numbers from <i>Convoy Report</i> and <i>Scientist's flash drive</i> to unlock the door and get the document. This is also a good place to sleep if it's getting late or shelter during a blowout.</p>

<h2 id="uhsfacc">UHSF Accident Report</h2>

<p>In Lab X-10, go to the Encyclopedia of your PDA and use the Access Code to open the first locked door. There is no code in this mod for the second locked door that's in a side room off to the right, and the code from the vanilla version, 342089, does not work. Make your way past the civilian zombies and down the stairs. Find the locked door to the right of the stairs. Go to the Encyclopedia of your PDA and use the Access Code to unlock the third door to find the report in the stash box.</p>

<h2 id="acc2">NPP Accident #2</h2>

<p>From the <i>UHSF Accident Report</i> room in Lab X-10, continue on to the Brain Scorcher control room. You'll meet a Controller and two Burers along the way. As you enter the control room, make your way to the cylinder on the right and down to the bottom to find the stash box with the document. And now it's on to Pripyat.</p>

<h2 id="muts2">Mutations Report #2</h2>

<p>When you spawn in Pripyat you get the <i>Find the lost UA-DZ32 squad</i> task that you can ignore for now. As you make your way north down the main boulevard, Monolith fighters are in the same spots as the vanilla version. Be careful not to shoot Loners dressed in Freedom suits.</p>

<ol>
	<li>Turn right (east) at the end of the boulevard and continue to the end of the street where there's an open gate on the left (north). This building is the kindergarten.</li>
	<li>Go up the steps in the far left corner of the yard and into the building.</li>
	<li>Turn right (east) and go through the doorway, then right (south) again to find the stairs on the left.</li>
	<li>Up the stairs and through the doorway on the left.</li>
	<li>Make your way to the south end of the building to find a doorway on the right.</li>
	<li>Make one more left to find the stash box with the document.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="UHSF1">UHSF Documents #1</h2>

<ol>
	<li>From the kindergarten, fight through the underground car-park to the northwest.</li>
	<li>When you get to the other side and up to street level, turn right (east) and go into the connected buildings running north/south.</li>
	<li>Make your way north, watching for Monolith on rooftops and in the street.</li>
	<li>At the northern end of the buildings, find the open door on the right and go down a few steps.</li>
	<li>Go through the doorway on the left, down the hallway, left again, and past the elevator to the stairs.</li>
	<li>Go up the stairs to the third floor where the elevator doors are open.</li>
	<li>Drop down to the top of the elevator to find the backpack containing the document.</li>
</ol>

<p>The <i>Find the lost UHSF Documents</i> task updates with the <i>FInd the CNPP Accident Report #3</i> step.</p>

<h2 id="acc3">CNPP Accident Report #3</h2>

<p>From the elevator shaft with <i>UHSF Documents #1</i>, drop down into the elevator (which is very tricky) and retrace your steps to street level. Exit the building through the opening along the north and continue north to the large paved area. Then turn west and use the wall as cover to work your way to the theater/Monolith Headquaters. Enter the building through the north entrance and through the doorway on the right. Cross the room and down the steps. Turn either way and continue down into the basement to find the stash box with the document. The <i>Find the lost UHSF Documents</i> task updates with the <i>Find Strelok's flash drive</i> step.</p>

<h2 id="strelokfd">Strelok's flash drive</h2>

<p>From Monolith Headquaters, go out the north entrance and go west to the connected buildings on that side of town. Just as with <i>UHSF Documents #1</i>, use this connecting part on the ground floor as cover from snipers and make your way to the south end. Same as before, down a few steps, two lefts, pass the elevator, and up the stairs to the third floor. Turn right and follow the hallway until you come to a room on the left with a doorway to another room on the left. Find the backpack on the floor with the flash drive. The <i>Find the lost UHSF Documents</i> task updates with the <i>Find the X18 Lab Access Code</i> step.</p>

<h2 id="x18">X18 Lab Access Code</h2>

<p>From the <i>Strelok's flash drive</i> stash, make your way back to the north end of the connected buildings along the east. Then, on to the stadium and CNPP. Again, the usual Monolith snipers and ground troups to work through. When you get to the hole in the wall, or the open gate, go to the southeast corner of the main building and make your way to the stairs. You can jump up to each of the first three platforms until the steps are no longer missing. Take the stairs all the way to the roof and, staying away from the edge to avoid ground fire, go west to the next set of stairs. Use the binoculars to look southeast to the right of the building on the tracks and <i>Find the lost UA-DZ32 squad</i>. Go there, talk to the commander by the radio and offer to radio for assistance to complete the task. Now make your way back along the tracks to the Sarcophagus transition point.</p>

<p>When you spawn in the Sarcophagus, you're on a spiral staircase with a broken-off bottom. For some reason, you can't just walk off and have to jump over the rail. Deal with the Gauss-carrying Monolith at the end of the hallway and the others in the next hallway all the way around. For this next part, you need more than -20 radiation on your belt. One Fireball isn't quite enough. Go into the next room and down the ladder on the left. About halfway is a room on the left with a stash box and the document. The <i>Find the lost UHSF Documents</i> task updates with the <i>Find the documents from Lab X16</i> step.</p>

<div><b>NOTE:</b> If you took the <i>Find the family rifle, and the Goldfish artifact</i>, be sure to check the wooden box in the far corner of the room.</div>

<h2 id="x16doc">Documents from Lab X16</a></h2>

<p>From the <i>X18 Lab Access Code</i> stash box, continue on to the Sarcophagus:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Go back up the ladder and fight your way to, and up, the staircase.</li>
	<li>When you get to the top, instead of going to the right, go left as you would to get to the Wish Granter.</li>
	<li>Follow the passage to the right and into the first doorway on the right, which is the damaged reactor.</li>
	<li>Follow the narrow passage into the reactor room and stay to the left as you go up the mound until your way is blocked by rods.</li>
	<li>Use the metal plate to get to the ladder and climb up.</li>
	<li>Turn left and go to the next ladder to go up into the reactor room.</li>
	<li>Turn left and follow the edge of the opening until you can see the tall ladder mounted to the wall.</li>
	<li>Climb the ladder and follow the ledge to the left, continuing on the steal truss.</li>
	<li>Move right around the metal plate to the ledge with the campfire and hole in the wall.</li>
	<li>Go through the hole and past the pillar about halfway to the next wall (you should see the flames of another campfire on the left).</li>
	<li>Turn left and go past the cement slab on its side until you can turn left again.</li>
	<li>Go into this area of cement blocks staying against the wall on the left and turn right to follow that wall.</li>
	<li>When you get to the cement block that forces you to go around to the right, stay against the wall on the right until the break is low enough for you to see over. You should see a stash box with the document.</li>
</ol>

<p>The <i>Find the lost UHSF Documents</i> task updates with the <i>Find the Mutation Report #3</i> step. The description says you need to find another code, which you already have. The only place left to look is the part of Lab X-18 that you couldn't get to before. But now that you have the code to the door, you can complete your Lab X-18 investigation.</p>

<h2 id="mutes3">Mutations Report #3</h2>

<p>From the Sarcophagus, go back to the beginning where the first Monolith soldier with a Gauss was at the end of the hallway. At the other end of the hallway, turn right to the transition point outside. When you spawn, go east to the train tracks, turn northeast toward the stairs and use the roof again. Then, find your way back to Pripyat > Radar/Red Forest > Army Warehouses > Rostok > Garbage > Dark Valley.</p>

<div><b>NOTE:</b> The CNPP/Pripyat transition point is a little tricky: Stand on the right side curb up against the post for the gate and jump.</div>

<div><b>TIPS:</b> In Pripyat, I find it easier (less Monolith) to move south on the east side of town. Monolith has ambushes set up along the west side of the boulevard. Go all the way down to the rubble and clear out the ambush there. For some reason, you can't climb over the rubble, but have to go back north and around the building where there's another ambush that you should be able to slip past if you stay against the building. Also, I'm never sure who is waiting for me at the spawn point in Radar/Red Forest, so be ready for a fight.</div>

<p>When you get to Lab X-18, use the code (which should be in your PDA Encyclopedia) that you got from the <a href="#x18">Sarcophagus</a> to open the first locked door. As soon as the door opens you become contaminated with the X-Virus again. You have just enough time to get to the stash containing the vaccine. Go down the stairs and straight out the doorway past the elevator to the end of the hallway. Take the doorway on the right that leads down to the Psydogiant. You can either fight the mutant or continue on to the stairs on the right. The stash box in this room has the vaccine. There may also be one in the refrigerator. You only need one so you can sell the other if you want.</p>

<p>Now head back to the center room with the elevator and down the hallway on the left to the door. This door is not locked, but the next one is. Use the second code to unlock the door into the lab. Now, there are several ways to kill a Poltergeist or Pyrogeist. My personal favorite is with buck shot (aiming just above center), but F1 grenades work if your timing is right. I've seen videos where the player shoots the flames, but that seems to take a lot of ammo. Anyway, go to the bottom of the stairs on the right side of the room and let the Pyrogeist have it. Then go up to the observation room and get the document out of the stash box on the far side of the room. This completes the <i>Find the lost UHSF Documents</i> task and gives you the <i>Find the Decoder</i> task.</p>

<p>Go back down the steps and up the ramp on the far side of the room. Turn right, go through the doorway, and stop. Turn left to find the backpack containing the decoder. This completes the task and gives you another <i>Find the lost UHSF Documents</i> task with <i>Find the documents from the Hotel in Pripyat</i> step. The last known location is the WarLab in Monolith Control. So, back to CNPP.</p>

<h2 id="hotel">Documents from the Hotel in Pripyat</h2>

<p>Picking up from the top of the stairs in Sarcophagus, turn right this time and follow the hallway to a large mound that has spilled into the passage. Just beyond is a small alcove with a ladder going up. At the top, slide left off the ladder and continue in that direction to the locked door. Press the action key to activate the decoder and take cover as Monolith squads start spawning at the other end of the room. Fight them off until the decoder finishes and enter the next room to transition to Monolith Control.</p>

<p>Fight your way around Monolith Control to the WarLab, the last batch of Monolith in this map. When you've cleared the room, enter and go around the right to the far wall. Turn around and find the stash box behind one of the cabinets. This completes the <i>Find the lost UHSF Documents</i> task with <i>Find the documents from the Hotel in Pripyat</i> step with no direction in your PDA, just the document description to complete the mission. Go through the doorway and the lab, down another hallway and up some stairs to a transition point back outside CNPP on the north side.</p>

<p>At this point it seems you have two options: take the traditional route through the portals, or use the nearby BTR. The traditional route doesn't seem to work as I can't get past the first teleport. The BTR is much easier. So, exit the building and turn left (west). Go to the wall and turn right (north). You should be able to see the BTR ahead. Turn the BTR east and follow the road to the other side of the complex. There are three gates along the north wall. Your destination is the far east gate. Use the map to see when to turn north and follow the road to the awaiting helicopter. The read the conversation to learn of Priboi's reward.</p>
