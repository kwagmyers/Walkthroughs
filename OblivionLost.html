<h1>Oblivion Lost</h1>

<p>Last Revision: January 2021</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>This guide is based on Oblivion Lost, version 3.1 Definitive Edition with default setup (at installation) and added key bindings in the following list. Played at Master level.</p>

<p>Keybindings added to the user.ltx file (syntax in <i>italic</i>).</p>

<ul>
	<li>Start/stop vehicle engine - <i>bind turn_engine kNUMPAD0</i> (The Mod'ers suggest using the B key, but I'm use to using the number pad zero key after playing <a href="ogse.html" target="_blank">O.G.S.E.</a></li>
	<li>Standard view - <i>bind cam_1 kF1</i></li>
	<li>Third-person view - <i>bind cam_2 kF2</i></li>
	<li>Another Third-person view - <i>bind cam_3 kF3</i></li>
</ul>

<p>For the first part, this mod follows the same storyline as the vanilla Shadow of Chernobyl with a few surprises I'll leave out for now. So, I'm not going to walk you through the whole SOC part, but just some notes. I've only played this mod once, on my way to Priboi Story Overhaul, which assumes you've played Oblivion Lost. After playing the mod, I understand way it is recommended.</p>

<h2>Tips</h2>

<ul>
	<li>Headshots save ammo.</li>
	<li>Exoskeleton suits aren't worth the trouble. There are times when you have to sprint, and mutant attacks can be very expensive to repair.</li>
	<li>BTRs are not mutant proof. Plus, it seems that you can't access the gun.</li>
	<li>Sniper rifles, like the SVDm-2 and SVUmk2, are very inaccurate and you're better off sticking with Assault Rifles. The AN-94 Abakan with a scope is all you need (headshots save ammo). Bartendar and Sakharov may have an HK G36K for sale for going up against Mercs and Monolith (you can get plenty of ammo off the dead).</li>
	<li>When a Psydogiant gets ready to stomp, get ready to jump. If you're in the air you won't take any damage from the shockwaves.</li>

<h2 id="cordon">Cordon</h2>

<p>No significant variation except the military at the northern checkpoint spawn reinforcements about 30 seconds after you kill the first sqaud. So don't spend too much time looting.</p>

<h2 id="x10">Lab X-10</h2>

<p>First, I've always made a habit of saving after terminating each Monolith squad going through the Red Forest/Radar on my way to the lab. This is especially helpful with this mod as I always seem to get about halfway through when a blowout occurs. Since the only shelter I know of is the tunnel at the end of the first side road, and is guarded by Monolith, you may need to roll back a save or two to get back to Army Warehouses and hold up in the northern farmsted.</p>

<p>When you enter Lab X-10 you actually spawn in Lab X-9, which is the Monolith Control map populated with mutants. Be sure to bring plenty of F1 grenades.</p>

<h2 id="cnpp">CNPP</h2>

<p>This is where things get tricky (and way too many crashes). There's no Monolith or Military, but plenty of mutants. Too many to fight, in fact. So, here's how I got around them:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Go straight (north) down the road you spawn on until you get to the open gate on the left (west).</li>
	<li>Go through the gate and sprint to the nearest corner of the large building on the right (to the northwest). I tried this in an Exoskeleton suit and it didn't go well.</li>
	<li>Sprint along the wall until you get to the stairs.</li>
	<li>Jump up to the first platform, make a u-turn right, walk to the edge of the platform and jump to the second.</li>
	<li>Jump again to the third platform where you can now use steps.</li>
	<li>Continue to the roof.</li>
	<li>Go all the way west past the open door to the Sarcophagus, where there's three Burers waiting for you.</li>
	<li>Continue on until you get to three pipes coming out of the wall and to a small building.</li>
	<li>Walk along the pipes to the building and wait for either a Burer or Bloodsucker to come within range. Burers take two F1 grenades, or three/four VOG-25s. Hopefully, you can take them out one at a time.</li>
</ol>

<p>That should get you into the Sarcophagus.</p>

<div><b>NOTE:</b> While in the Sarcophagus you hear a recording of the meltdown. It seems these scientists must have studied in England. Also, take note of the transition point on the far end of the first hallway. You'll need that later.</div>

<h2 id="cnpp2">CNPP2</h2>

<p>When you finish the Monolith Control level and spawn on the north side of the power plant's main building, your task is to <i>Seek out the izlom at the roof of the NPP</i>. There are no Monolith to shoot at, but those mutants haven't gone anywhere. As long as you stay close to the building they leave you alone. There are no teleports, either. Here's how to get to the izlom:</p>

<ol>
	<li>From the northwest corner of the building (spawn point), go out the doorway, around the wall on the right (east) and northeast the wall that runs north/south. Don't bother with the nearby stairs as you can't get to the izlom.</li>
	<li>Continue north along the wall on the right and around the corner to the metal box.</li>
	<li>Jump up on the box and then over the fence and up the nearby ladder.</li>
	<li>Find the next ladder to the southeast, and south to the following ladder.</li>
	<li>Go east to the end of the area and down the ladder.</li>
	<li>Make your way east to the target on your map and talk to the izlom. This gives you two more tasks, <i>Find the Balance Fragment in the Dead City</i> and <i>Find the MZ-X Suit in Lab-X26</i>.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="balance">Find the Balance Fragment in the Dead City</h2>

<div><b>TIP: </b>While collecting these fragments, your best weapon is speed. If you try to fight your way through every mutant and enemy, you will use a lot of ammo and time. If you stop to fight one mutant, ten more show up.</div>

<p>From CNPP, the only see one way to the Dead City is back the way you came to the Army Warehouses where the Dead City transition point is in the northwest corner of the map. The transition point to the Generators in the northeast corner of the CNPP map is for later.</p>

<p>When you spawn back into Monolith Control, you get a message from Researcher Kaydanovsky telling you Sakharov has some jobs for you. There is also a transition point from Yantar to Dead City. See <a href="#sakharov">Sakharov Optional Tasks</a> for additional information.</p>

<p>If the Pyrogeists are still circling around the power generator room, you can take them out with a single F1 grenade. In the Sarcophagus, any Monolith that you didn't kill while waiting for the decoder to open the door are now waiting for you, and they brought a few friends alone, too. Now, remember that transition point I mentioned before, at the end of the first hallway. That takes you back outside with all the mutants.</p>

<p>Sprint east to the stairs and back to the roof. Continue east to the other stairs, down, but stop when you get to the fourth platform from the bottom where you can access the ledge that runs the side of the building. Continue east to the last set of pipes and walk off the ledge onto the pipes (don't jump to avoid taking damage). Get as close to the gate as possible before sprinting off the pipes. Keep sprinting all the way to the Pripyate transition point as the Chimeras are probably following you until you get down the road a ways.</p>

<p>When you get to Dead City, your map is not much use, with only Artyom's location marked. But the map has no details. If you've played another mod with this map, like <a href="ogse.html" target="_blank">O.G.S.E.</a>, you can probably find your way around. There are two buildings in the center of the city, one is a gym with lots of windows in front and the other has a bust of Vladimir Lenin inside. This is the building you want. Go up the stairs, turn right and into the first door on the left. Go to the back of the room and through another door on the left to find the box with the document inside. Take the document to Artyom, who then gives you the <i>Find the Dimension Fragment at the Swamp</i> task. The transition point is north.</p>

<h2 id="dimension">Find the Dimension Fragment at the Swamp</h2>

<p>If you took the <i>Eliminate the Military soldiers in the Swamp</i> task from Sakharov, head west from your spawn point to find them at the Machine Yard, and Village Ruins. Continue west to the Boat House and find the <i>Terror Fragment</i> in the southeast corner of the cabin. Then southeast to the Fishing Hamlet. There's a Military guard in the tower and a squad in the complex to be neutralized first. The document is in the east building, south room. Take that to Degtarev who is north of your location. Degtarev gives you the <i>Find the Time Fragment in the Red Forest</i> task, which is also the map from Clear Sky. Go north again and over the tracks to the transition point.</p>

<h2 id="time">Find the Time Fragment in the Red Forest</h2>

<div><b>NOTE: </b>I had a lot of trouble with crashes during reloads, especially near the Old Mine. I seem to remember this from the vanilla Clear Sky, even with the -noprefetch and lower video settings.</div>

<p>When I spawned in the Red Forest, I had to take cover immediately in the bus on the left side of the road. About half the Russian Army decided to greet me. The Red Forest is packed with Military. I found that the quicker I got to the document, and then to the contact, the less chance of an engagement.</p>

<p>If you're familiar with the Clear Sky version of the Red Forest, you know where Forester lives (Mining Complex). If not, go through the gateway on the right going into the forest and follow the path left, which ends just after the fork. Go to the left of the tall evergreen tree until you pick up the path again. Follow the path until it ends again and continue in the same direction until you find another path. If you get lost, turn left, find the bluff, and follow to the right. Go right on that path, left at the fork, and continue on until you exit the forest. Go into the tall building and around the elevator to find the document box under the stairs.</p>

<p>Now to the Refugee Camp. Go back into the forest and follow the bluff on the left until the large bolder jetting out. Turn slightly to the right and you should see another bluff. If not, just sprint in that direction. Follow this bluff to the Refugee Camp and talk to Diatlov in the white Ecologist suit. He gives you the <i>Find the Flame Fragment in Limansk</i> task.</p>

<h2 id="flame">Find the Flame Fragment in Limansk</h2>

<p>Turn around from Diatlov and follow the same bluff back the way that you came until you find the wall. Follow the wall to the right to the gateway and exit the forest. There's more Military guarding the bridge, so use the bolders as cover and clear the area. Cross the bridge and, instead of entering the tunnel, turn left, go to the fence, turn right, and go into the doorway to the transition point.</p>

<p>Make your way to the Bridge Outpost, which is a fairly linear path. As work through the last house, you can find the document in the center of one room. Continue on to report Wolfgang Mengele on the upper floor of the Construction Site. He gives you the <i>Find The Sun Fragment in the Red Forest</i> task, which sends you back to the Red Forest.</p>

<h2 id="sun">Find The Sun Fragment in the Red Forest</h2>

<p>The Military that you cleared out at the bridge have respawned, so proceed with caution. The document is in a cave northwest of the tank. There are also several Burers and Psydogiants in the immediate area. The safest approach is to stay along the bluff on the left as you exit the tunnel and take out any mutants as you go. This is a good time to use some of the VOG-25s the Military carry. Report back to Diatlov at the Refugee Camp and he gives you the <i>Find the Moon Fragment in Pripyat</i> task. Use the transition point north of the Mining Complex to Radar/Red Forest and then on to Pripyat.</p>

<h2 id="moon">Find the Moon Fragment in Pripyat</h2>

<p>If you've completed the O.G.S.E. <a href="ogse.html#old" target="_blank">Old man's daughter</a> optional task, you are familiar with the apartment building on the west side of town. If not, follow the same path as before to the underground carpark. Go west past the carpark entrence to the park on the right (north). Go northwest through the park and cross the street. Continue west down the street to the side street that runs north/south. Enter the first building, turn left (south), and around the corner on the right. Go down the steps and follow the hallway to the left to find the open elevator with the document. Go back to the street heading east this time toward the hotel. Go in the door nearest Kanyhalos' location and to the top of the stairs. Tell Kanyhalos that you have the Moon Fragment and he gives you the <i>Find the Ancient Fragment at the Generators</i> task.</p>

<p>The last document is also in Pripyat, but you have to come back through to get to Priboi, so you can pick it up now or later. Exit the hotel and cross the street that runs north/south on the east side of the hotel. Turn left (north) and go up the street to where the roof has collapsed. Use the rubble to get to the open window, climb in, and find the hallway. Go past the stairs and elevator to the next apartment to find the <i>Hatred Fragment</i>.</p>

<h2 id="ancient">Find the Ancient Fragment at the Generators</h2>

<p>The only way I can see to get to the Generators is back through CNPP, Sarcophagus, Monolith Control, and back out the other side of CNPP to the transition point in the northeast of the map. The easiest way I've found is to go north from exiting Monolith Control to the road that runs east/west. Turn right (east) and go until you see the train tracks along side the road on the left. Switch over to the tracks and stay left at every fork. This takes you to the road that runs north to the Generators transition point</p>

<p>When you spawn, you're facing toward the transition point. Turn to the right so that you're facing southeast (check your map) and sprint toward Floer's location. Unlike the other fragments, this one is very close to the contact. Just southwest of his location is a small gray barn with the document. I had to climb the ladder and take out four Bloodsuckers first. Anyway, take the document to Floear and he gives you the <i>Find the Terror Fragment at the Swamp</i> task, which you already have. However, the task requires you to see the contact in Dead City.</p>

<h2 id="terror">Find the Terror Fragment at the Swamp</h2>

<p>If you followed my instructions for the <a href="#dimension">Find the Dimension Fragment at the Swamp</a> task, you already have this and only need to report to the contact, Alexey Badalov in Dead City. I think you probably know how to get there now, so I'll pick it up where you spawn from Army Warehouses to Dead City. Go straight to the end of the road, turn right, then left. Go to the far door of the second building and to the top floor. Alexey is in the apartment on the far left. He gives you the <i>Find the Hatred Fragment in Pripyat</i> task.</p>

<h2 id="hatred">Find the Hatred Fragment in Pripyat</h2>

<p>If you followed my instructions for the <a href="#moon">Find the Moon Fragment in Pripyat</a> task, you may already have this one and only need to report back to Priboi. If not, you can pick it up on your way through Pripyat. Take the usual route to the hotel and turn right (east) and cross the street that runs north/south on the east side of the hotel. Turn left (north) and go up the street to where the roof has collapsed. Use the rubble to get to the open window, climb in, and find the hallway. Go past the stairs and elevator to the next apartment to find the document. Then continue on back to CNPP. When you get back to Priboi and give him the fragments, he gives you the <i>Defeat Blackhand and get the Lost Fragment from him</i> task.</p>

<h2 id="lost">Defeat Blackhand and get the Lost Fragment from him</h2>

<p>From Priboi, take the same path as the <a href="#ancient">Find the Ancient Fragment at the Generators</a> task. When you spawn in Generators, turn around to face south. On your map, you want the Lab-X26 transition point as your destination. Go through the front gate and straight to the lab door in the center of the complex. Open the door and go through to move to enter the lab.</p>

<p>Lab-X26 is actually Lab X-8 from Call of Pripyat. The objective it to get the MZ-X Suit. There's a Controller that is most likely in the lowest level, where the suit is. I found my best chance was taking the center door leading down some steps, turn right and right again through a doorway. Follow the passage to a large room, down the steps, and turn around to find the opening in the floor. If you haven't met the Controller by now, it's in this next level. Go down the ladder and to the end of the passage. Turn left and go down to the last passage. At the end of the passage is a stash box with the MZ-X Suit.</p>

<p>Now, get out of the lab. When you spawn in the doorway of the lab, Blackhand is standing in front of you. Move left for the best cover. As you fight with him, Controllers spawn to help him. If your psy level gets too high, go back into the lab to recover. I had fight the Military as well, but I've seen videos where there was no Military. Once the area is clear of enemies, get the fragment off Blackhand and head back to CNPP. Give Priboi the last fragment and he turns back into human form. Priboi then gives you the <i>Let Diatlov know about what happened to Priboi</i> task.</p>

<h2 id="diatlov">Let Diatlov know about what happened to Priboi</h2>

<p>There are two options for getting back to the Red Forest, but you have to go CNPP > Pripyat > Radar first. The you can take the transition point to the Red Forest near Lab X-10 (putting you at the northern end of the Red Forest), or continue on to the Army Warehouses and use the transition point along the northern edge of the map. This second option puts you very close to Diatlov. Talk to him to complete the task and play the game in freestyle.</p>

<h2 id="sakharov">Sakharov Optional Tasks</h2>

<p>Talk to Sakharov after completing the <a href="#cnpp2">Seek out the izlom at the roof of the NPP</a> task and ask him for a job. He offers you several, mostly mutant body part, purge, etc. But there's a catch: you only get to pick one Transmutate and one Eliminate task at a time (Sakharov doesn't offer them to you after you pick one). The downside to these is that you have to return to Yantar each time in order to get a new task.</p>

<div><b>TIP: </b>Never take a mutant body part task or an artifact task until you have the item. Otherwise, you may never see what you're after and fail the task.</div>

<p>Here are three I thought I'd provide some clarity on:</p>

<ul>
	<li><i>Eliminate the Mercenaries in the Dead City</i> - Do this along with <a href="#balance">Find the Balance Fragment in the Dead City</a>. I only had to kill a few Mercs in the city square to satisfy the task requirements.</li>
	<li><i>Eliminate the Military soldiers in the Swamp</i> - This is the Clear Sky Great Swamp and you may want to look online for an image since the ingame map is blurred. Also, none of the stash boxes are accessible. I found soldiers at most of the main locations, but completed the task after going to Machine Yard, Village Ruins, and Pump Station. I was fortunate that a Bloodsucker had done the work for me at the Pump Station and only had to kill it.</li>
	<li><i>Bring the FN2000 Prototype</i> - You can accept this task along with the Eliminate tasks and pick the weapon up on one of your many trips to CNPP. The prototype is a modified FT-200M on the ground next to a dead soldier. You won't see the locator on the map, but shows on the HUD when you get close to it. Coming from Pripyat, move to the right side of the road to avoid the attention of all the mutants. When you get close to the train tracks, you should see the location on your HUD.</li>
</ul>
