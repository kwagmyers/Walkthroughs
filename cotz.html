<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>With this mod, it's important to know that the first several game-time days are more freeplay than storyline. This first part is a series of seemingly random tasks that have no connection to each other. You may find that some tasks repeat either by the same character or different characters. The goal is to make it to the start of the storyline, which is <i>Find Doc</i>. For me, I got this task on day 25 in my first playthrough and day 15 in the second playthrough. It may also be based on the number of tasks, which looks to be 35. I'll need more playthroughs to confirm that theory.</p>

<p>Tasks usually have three parts: "Meet with..." where you must report to the specified character, the actual task where you perform the requirement, and "Return for your reward" where you've done what was asked of you and must now go back to the character to complete the task and receive the next "Meet with...". It is also important to know that tasks may time out after about eight game-time hours during the "Meet with..." part. So, if you want to explore, I recommend doing it during the <i>Return for your reward</i> part of the task.</p>

<p>One last thing; I'm sure this is not a complete list of tasks. Many of the tasks are simple, go here and do this. Some tasks require you to escort one or more NPCs. Also, there are several optional tasks that are not included. This list is comprised of the main tasks only from playthroughs at Master level with no add-ons, playing as a Loner and Clear Sky.</p>

<h3>Tips</h3>

<ul>
	<li>You start the game with a sleeping bag, but there's really no need for it. You never get tired with default settings, so you can play continuously. If you want to kill some time, there are plenty of sleep stations, at least one on each map. Check your PDA for the bed icon.</li>
	<li>With the exception of the RP-74, there seems to be plenty of ammo for all weapons. I recommend keeping Gauss Gun batteries as the Gauss is the best sniper rifle (Dragunovs are hard to come by).</li>
	<li>Your relationship with the various factions will change over the course of the game. Some factions will create alliances while others declare war on each other. For example, you may find yourself an enemy of the Ecologists. Use the Relations page of your PDA to keep track of it all.</li>
	<li>You can change factions, but not all can finish the game. I generally stick with Loner and Clear Sky factions.</li>
	<li>Wearing artifacts on your belt causes them to lose their effectiveness. So, only use them when needed and avoid leaving them on your belt as you would with the vanilla game.</li>
	<li>When you're in the southern maps (Cordon, Great Swamp, etc.) watch for Military helicopers and try to stay under the trees when possible. They seem to be attracted to gunfire. You can shoot them down with about 30-40 hits from an assault rifle. But, this causes some wear on your weapon. Sometimes you can hide behind a tree until it flies away.</li>
	<li>When escorting NPCs it's a good idea to keep an eye on the distance they are behind you, which is indicated on their images at the bottom of the screen. They sometimes stop to shoot a mutants, enemys, etc. and you can easily lose them.</li>
	<li>Items with three solid gray lines of condition are not tradable. You can use them with a repair kit, but there's no sense hauling them around and slowing you down.</li>
	<li>Any task requiring the retrieval of something from Bandits calls for a light inventory. Bandits move around and you may need to sprint across several maps to catch up to them.</li>
</ul>

<!--*******Seminov*******-->
<h3 id="seminov">Assistant Seminov</h3>

<p>Seminov belongs to the Ecologist faction in Yantar. You can get to Yantar from Wild Territory, the Agroprom swamp, and Dead City. He's usually patroling the swamp behind the portable research lab. Tell Seminov you have come to see him and he gives you the following tasks:</p>

<h4>Find Transistors for Seminov</h4>

<p>Seminov sends you to the front gate of the factory to find some transistors. I located them just inside the gate to the north next to a stash box. Return to Seminov and tell him that you did as he asked to complete the task. Now check your PDA for the next task.</p>

<h4>Recover Semenov's Stolen Documents</h4>

<p>So is it with an e or an i? Anyway, for this task I recommend a sniper rifle, but an assault rifle works, too. The challenge is to catch the extremely mobile Bandits. Consider stashing all but essential gear and sprinting to the location on your PDA. If you're lucky (and I was), the group will encounter a firefight and someone else does the job for you. Either way, with the Bandits down, search the bodies for the <i>Document Case</i>. Return to Seminov and tell him that you did as he asked to complete the task. Now check your PDA for the next task.</p>

<h4>Rid Bandits from Agroprom Underground</h4>

<div><b>NOTE: </b>The shack near the Bedrock Claws anomaly may have supplies inside that are difficult to pick up because of the Sleep action. My trick is to push the item(s) through an opening in the floor and pick it up outside the shack. Just be aware of the anomaly under the shack.</div>

<p>The target underground access requires you to backtrack halfway through the underground to the factory access. So, I recommend you start at the factory. I think it's easier to take out the Bandits this way as it provides better cover than fighting your way up the spiral stairs. For this task, any close-combat weapon works. Once the Bandits are down, return to Seminov and tell him that you did as he asked to complete the task. Now check your PDA for the next task.</p>

<!--Barkeep-->
<h3 id="barkeep">Meet with Barkeep</h3>

<p>It's not unusual to see Barkeep strolling around Rostok instead of behind the bar. He doesn't stop to talk though, so you have to wait until he gets back to his post to trade with him. Tell Barkeep you have come to see him and he gives you the following tasks:</p>

<h4>Barkeep's Bounty</h4>

<p>Similar to <a href="#sid1">Thread the Needle</a> and <a href="#cold">Kill the Profiteer</a>, Barkeep wants you to take out some Loner that killed another Loner in the bar without involving anyone else. There's no known location, so you have to find someone who will talk to you and tell them you are looking for someone. I had to go to the northern checkpoint and talk to three Dutyers before one of them suggested I look in Army Warehouses. After a few minute in Army Warehouses, a message displayed saying the target was east of the Bloodsucker Village. Only, I could not find him anywhere in the area. I asked another Loner who just happened to know where my target was, and gave me the location. Turns out he was with a group standing along the dirt road on the south side of the village. My guy was wearing a Merc uniform. When I shot him the others return fire. If you kill one of them you get a Friendly Fire message. I used the house west of their location for cover and bolted up the hill toward the Rostok transition point as soon as he hit the ground. Return to Barkeep and tell him that you did as he asked to complete the task. Now check your PDA for the next task.</p>

<div><b>NOTE: </b>The target's companions continue to be hostile throughout the rest of the game. But you can't return their fire without other Loners becoming hostile, too.</div>

<h4>Recover Missed Supply Delivery</h4>

<p>Barkeep sends you to his courier's hideout to find out what happened to a shipment. The hideout is in Outskirts and the shortest route from Rostok to Truck Cemetary and have the River Guide transport you to Outskirts. Unless you have completed <a href="#beard">Rescue Stingray 4 Crash Survivors</a>, in which case the River Guide has no boat and you have to use the Jupiter Underground. Go Army Warehouses > Red Forest > Jupiter. Monolith troups are stationed at the River Port along the northern coast, but you can sneak past them by moving around the southeast of those buildings.</p>

<p>For me, the hideout was located in the Grocery Store. But I have a feeling that the location is random. I found the white case setting next to the east wall in the large west room opposite the front doors. Return to Barkeep and tell him that you did as he asked to complete the task. Now check your PDA for the next task.</p>

<!--*******Beard*******-->
<h3 id="beard">Meet with Beard</h3>

<p>The only way to get to Zaton is through the Abandoned Hospital by way of Limansk, or Jupiter by way of Pripyat. Unless you are near the Truck Cemetary, you're probably better off taking the Limansk route. Tell Beard you have come to see him and he gives you the following tasks:</p>

<h4>Dangerous Mutant Extermination</h4>

<p>The same as <i>Open the Supply Line</i> with Owl, group of Bloodsuckers needs to be eliminated. I like using a shotgun on Bloodsuckers. Get as close to the group as possible and find something to climb up on, such as a boulder or vehicle. Then, shoot at them with a weapon of longer range, such as a pistol or assault rifle to get their attention and let them have it when they come close. Return to Beard and tell him that you did as he asked to complete the task. Now check your PDA for the next task.</p>

<h4>Hospital Assault</h4>

<p>This is the hospital in the Outskirts, the scene of the Unidentified Weapon in COP. I recommend a sniper or assault rifle for the task and shotgun for the mutants in the Jupiter Underground. Take three or four Loners with you to link up with another group waiting in Outskirts. Go southeast to the Jupiter transition point, straight south to Jupiter Underground, which takes you to Outskirts. Be aware that you can't go into Pripyat without the Psi helmet. If this is your first time through the underground, you can expect the usual mutants and Zombies from COP. If you've dealt with them already, be prepared for more mutants (they breed like rabbits down here). When you get to the other group you get a mission update to attack Monolith at the hospital, and the new group heads that way and enter the hospital on the west side. Return to Beard and tell him that you did as he asked to complete the task. Now check your PDA for the next task.</p>

<h4>Rescue Stingray 4 Crash Survivors</h4>

<p>Stingray 4 is also in the same location as in COP, which is the Jupiter Factory. Only this time it is much easier to get to as there are only a few mutants to deal with. I recommend a shotgun for the mutants and an assault rifle just in case you meet up with an enemy along the way.</p>

<p>When you get to the crash site you get an update telling you to look for clues as to where the survivors might be. Look on the ground around Stingray 4 for a PDA. Standing on top of the helicoper with your flashlight and night vision on seems to help. Pick it up to get another update telling you to search the Northwestern Tunnel. There, you find a Monolith squad and one Stingray 4 survivor. Take out the Monolith squad and talk to the survivor. If you insist that he comes with you, he promptly shoots you in the face. So, let him go and report back to Beard. Tell him that you did as he asked to complete the task. Now check your PDA for the next task.</p>

<div><b>NOTE: </b>This results in the survivor stealing River Guide's boat. Something to keep in mind when going from a southern map to Outskirts or Pripyat.</div>

<!--*******Cold*******-->
<h3 id="cold">Meet with Cold</h3>

<p>Apparently, Lebedev did not survive the blowout at the end of Clear Sky because Cold is now in charge. The traditional routes to the Great Swamp are available, being Cordon south of the Rookie Village and west of the Railroad Bridge on the north side of the tracks, as well as Agroprom southeast of the institute. Once you're at the Great Swamp, go south of the Fishing Hamlet, through the hole in the fence, and to the Cleak Sky base. Go to the room where Lebedev gave you your orders from, tell him you've come to see and he gives you the following tasks:

<h4>Kill the Profiteer</h4>

<p>Similar to <a href="#sid1">Thread the Needle</a> and <a href="#barkeep">Barkeep's Bounty</a>, you have to take out one guy without involving anyone else. The target is at the Cordon Railroad Bridge and you can use the Old Mill as cover. You can either use the attic or backside of the roof to shoot from. Return to Cold and tell him that you did as he asked to complete the task. Now check your PDA for the next task.</p>

<h4>Meet with Ivan Trodnik</h4>

<p>Cold tells you of a plan he has to infiltrate Monolith and turn off the Brain Scorcher. At the end of the conversation you get a new task, <a href="#trodnik">Meet with Ivan Trodnik</a> and the <i>Meet with Cold</i> task is complete.</p>

<h4>Protect Clear Sky Base</h4>

<p>Go north to the Village Ruins and take out the Military squad. While you're at it, don't be surprise to see a familiar old man in a long brown trench coat. Don't shoot him because you'll need him later. As for the Military, I like to approach the village either from the south or east where there's some cover. Take them out and scout the area if you want. Return to Cold and tell him that you did as he asked to complete the task. Now check your PDA for the next task.</p>

<!--*******Petrenko*******-->
<h3 id="petrenko">Colonel Petrenko</h3>

<p>Petrenko is in his usual spot at the south end of the Duty Rostok Headquarters. Tell Petrenko you have come to see him and he gives you the following tasks:</p>

<h4>Investigate Stingray 2 Crash Site</h4>

<p>To get to Zaton from Rostok, go Army Warehouses > Red Forest > Jupiter > Zaton and go west to the Iron Forest. Return to Petrenko and tell him that you did as he asked to complete the task. Now check your PDA for the next task.</p>

<h4>Junkyard Brawl</h4>

<p>Take two of the colonel's men and meet up with a Duty squad in Truck Cemetary. Then lead the attack on two Monolith squads. There are three updates to this task, so don't let the first two fool you into thinking it's over. You get an update when you meet the other Dutyers, another when you take out the first squad, and the third when the last Monolith is down. Return to Petrenko and tell him that you did as he asked to complete the task. Now check your PDA for the next task.</p>

<h4>Search Agroprom Underground</h4>

<div><b>NOTE: </b>The shack near the Bedrock Claws anomaly may have supplies inside that are difficult to pick up because of the Sleep action. My trick is to push the item(s) through an opening in the floor and pick it up outside the shack. Just be aware of the anomaly under the shack.</div>

<p>The Military lost some documents in the underground and Petrenko's men haven't been able to find them. The underground requires close-combat weaponry, such as a shotgun or assault rifle without a scope. If this is your first trip to the Agroprom Underground, there's Bandits near the factory entrance and Military at the air shaft, which is the target on your PDA. Since there's no cover when you enter through the air shaft, I recommend using the factory (in the center of the four large storage tanks in the northwest corner of the complex). A white case sits on the shelf in Strelok's Hideout where you found the flash drive in SOC. Return to Petrenko and tell him that you did as he asked to complete the task. Now check your PDA for the next task.</p>

<!--*******Dushman*******-->
<h3 id="dushman">Meet with Dushman</h3>

<p>Dushman is a trader in Dead City and is accessible from Yantar, Army Warehouses, and Limansk. Tell Dushman you have come to see him and he gives you the following tasks:</p>

<h4>Battle of Limansk Bridge</h4>

<p>This takes you to the Bridge Outpost in Limansk, which is just north of Dead City. Similar to the task in CS, clear the area in and around the building. When all Monolith fighters are down, another wave comes in from the left (west) along the creek. Return to Dushman and tell him that you did as he asked to complete the task. Now check your PDA for the next task.</p>

<h4>Investigate Stingray 3 Crash Site</h4>

<p>This is a repeat of COP where you contact Noah on how to get to the plateau. Only this time Noah doesn't show you how to use the portal. He gives you instructions, which I will provide with a little more clarity. You can view Noah's instructions by mousing over the task on your PDA.

<ol>
	<li>Enter the Burnt Village via the road leading in from the southwest.</li>
	<li>Cross the thermal field to the right to find the opening in the fence on the other side. When you approach the village, there's a bush on the right and a dead tree to the left of it. 
		<ol>
			<li>Throw a bolt in between to find a safe path and walk between the two until you're past the bush and can see the hole in the fence. You should be facing in the direction of a bent piece of metal sticking up from the ground.</li>
			<li>Walk toward the piece of metal until you can see the Skadovsk over the crest of the hill.</li>
			<li>Turn right and walk on the right side of a smal dead tree.</li>
			<li>Turn slightly left and walk on the right side of the barrel.</li>
		</ol>
	<li>Jump off the edge of the cliff to be transported to the plateau.</li>
</ol>

<p>There are no Snorks or dead soldiers, just the Plateau Case in the middle of the cave. Return to Dushman and tell him that you did as he asked to complete the task. Now check your PDA for the next task.</p>

<!--*******Voronin*******-->
<h3 id="voronin">General Voronin</h3>

<p>Voronin is in the Rostok Duty Headquarters. Tell Voronin you have come to see him and he gives you the following tasks:</p>

<h4>Stop the Killing Spree</h4>

<p>Voronin uses a little reverse psycology to talk you into wiping out a group of Bandits in Wild Territory. Here's a tip: Ask Mangun, the Duty technician, if there are any jobs and he might send you to the same spot to pick up his gunsmithing tools. Return to Voronin and tell him that you did as he asked to complete the task. Now check your PDA for the next task.</p>

<!--*******Hog*******-->
<h3 id="hog">Meet with Hog</h3>

<p>Hog is in Dead City, accessible from Yantar, Army Warehouses, and Limansk. Tell Hog you have come to see him and he gives you the following tasks:</p>

<h4>Gauss Gun Components</h4>

<p>This is the second of what I'm calling the <i>Gauss Gun Trilogy</i>. You must complete the <i>Infiltrate Lab X-8</i> task to aquire this task. When you return from the <i>Infiltrate Lab X-8</i> task, Hog offers to build you a Gauss Gun and gives you this task requiring you to find the components he needs. The capacitors and spool of wire are laying on the ground near the Council Building. In my first playthrough, I found the capacitors up near the west wall of the building and the wire just down (south) the street. Second time, the wire was near the west wall of the building and the capacitors were in the Zaton Iron Forest under the Stingray 2 crash site in the Secret Workshop. You have to check all the Electro anomalies for the Flash artifact. Here is a list of them nearby:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Dead City - Proving Ground Anomaly on the east side near the Army Warehouses transition point.</li>
	<li>Army Warehouses - Shock Theropy Anomaly in the northwest corner of the map, near the Dead City transition point.</li>
	<li>Yantar - Tesla and Edison Anomalies on either side of the Production Complex front gate.</li>
	<li>Wild Territory - Crispy Train Anomaly in the northwest corner of the map.</li>
	<li>Wild Territory - Sparkle Deadlock Anomaly under the west-side overpass.</li>
</ul>

<p>Return to Hog with the artifact and tell him that you did as he asked to complete the task. Now you have to <i>Wait for Gauss Gun Completion</i>.

<h4>Infiltrate Lab X-8</h4>

<p>This is the first of what I'm calling the <i>Gauss Gun Trilogy</i>, which is important if you don't already have one. This task is also a repeat of the COP task <i>Laboratory X8: find documents concerning experiments</i> where you have to fight Monolith and Zombies inside the Yubileiny Service Center, turn the elevator generator on, and take the elevator down into the lab. To get to the Outskirts, go east to Army Warehouses, then southeast to Truck Cemetary and find the River Guide in the northeast corner of the map. He will take you to Outskirts. Here is the walkthrough for the service center:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Use the east entrance, find the stairs on the right (north), and go up to the fifth floor.</li>
	<li>Go south to the central hallway and turn right, then to the end of the hallway and turn right again.</li>
	<li>Use the northwest stairs to go up to the top floor, turn left and take the first left. The generator is immediately on the left.</li>
	<li>As you approach the generator a screen message displays, <i>Activate generator (F)</i>. Switch the generator on and the message closes.</li>
	<li>Use the northwest stairs again to go down two floors.</li>
	<li>Go to the southwest stairs and drop through the hole.</li>
	<li>Continue down the stairs to the ground floor.</li>
	<li>Go north to elevator and press the button to access the lab.</li>
</ol>

<p>There's a Burer, Controller, and two Snorks waiting for you in Lab X-8, but you may only have to deal with the Snorks. Here's the Lab X-8 walkthrough:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Go through the doorway with the knife and fork sign and down the stairs.</li>
	<li>Drop through the hole in the floor (this is where the Snorks come at you.</li>
	<li>Follow the arrow pointing north with the old-school computer sign.</li>
	<li>Go through the doorway in the partition frame to the workstation to the northwest of the doorway.</li>
	<li>Pick up the <i>Prototype Weapon Specifications</i> document. If it's not there, go to the cafeteria (if it is there, skip to step 6):
		<ol>
			<li>Turn southeast and go through the doorway at the other side of the room. There may be a Burer above you as you go through the doorway, so be ready for that.</li>
			<li>Take out the Burer, go up the stairs, and through the door where the Burer was.</li>
			<li>Go to the table on the far side of the room to check if the document is there. Since I've had limited playthroughs, these are the only two places I've found. If it's not here, head for the elevator shaft:
				<ol>
					<li>Back to the room with the Burer.</li>
					<li>Go down the steps and make a U-turn left to get to the elevators.</li>
					<li>Enter the second shaft and climb the ladders to the third floor.</li>
					<li>Follow around to the left where three Burers, and possibly a Controller, wait for you.</li>
					<li>When the way is clear, take the grate catwalk to the left, up the stairs, and into the room where my guess is, the document is on the table. If I'm wrong, please drop me an email.</li>
					<li>Now back down the elevator shaft and pick up at the test tube and beaker sign.</li>
				</ol></li>
			<li>If you do have the document, go back to the room with the hole in the floor and up the stairs to the exit.</li>
		</ol>	
	</li>
	<li>Turn southeast and go through the doorway at the other side of the room. There may be a Burer above you as you go through the doorway, so be ready for that. If you keep moving you can probably ignore it.</li>
	<li>Go down the steps on the right and through the doorway with the test tube and beaker sign.</li>
	<li>Turn left and follow the hallway. You probably need to jump over the Fruit Punch anomaly.</li>
	<li>Up the stairs and cross the room to the stairs that turn.</li>
	<li>Up the stairs to the exit.</li>
</ol>

<p>Return to Hog and tell him that you did as he asked to complete the task. The conversation leads into the next task, <i>Gauss Gun Components</i>.</p>

<h4>Retrieve the Crashed UAV Memory Module</h4>

<p>This is the same UAV as in COP, located in the northwest corner of the Jupiter map. To get there from Dead City, go north to Limansk > Abandoned Hospital > Zaton, cross the map to the Jupiter transition point in the southeast corner of the map. Go west along the north side of the map to the crashed drone. Another option is Limansk > Red Forest > Jupiter and go northwest to the crash site.</p>

<p>Unlike COP, the module is under a bush northwest of the drone. If you are thinking of stopping by Yanov Station, remember to check your relations with both Duty and Freedom first. There is no cease fire and either faction will attack inside the station. Return to Hog and tell him that you did as he asked to complete the task. Now check your PDA for the next task.</p>

<h4>Search the Agroprom Underground</h4>

<div><b>NOTE: </b>The shack near the Bedrock Claws anomaly may have supplies inside that are difficult to pick up because of the Sleep action. My trick is to push the item(s) through an opening in the floor and pick it up outside the shack. Just be aware of the anomaly under the shack.</div>

<p>From Dead City you can get to Agroprom by going south to Yantar and using the southeast transition point to the Agroprom swamp. Access to the underground is located in the center of the four large storage tanks at the factory, man hole along the north wall of the institute, or the ventilation shaft on the hill between the two. The brief case is in the passageway leading to the institute man hole where you met the Controller in SOC. Along the way you will meet the same Bloodsucker, Military, and Controller that you did in SOC. Return to Hog and tell him that you did as he asked to complete the task. Now check your PDA for the next task.</p>

<h4>Shocking Documents</h4>

<p>This task sends you to Wild Territory. You can go east to Army Warehouses > Rostok or south to Yantar. The underground tunnel is accessible from the north near where you met Kruglov in SOC. Starting near the north wall, walk over the hood of the UAZ-469 (jeep) and along the south side of the trailer with tank. Jump up onto the overturned car, sprint and jump to the spools. Continue to the larger shipping container, drop down on the far (east) side and find the <i>Document Case</i> inside. Return to Hog and tell him that you did as he asked to complete the task. Now check your PDA for the next task.</p>

<h4>Wait for Gauss Gun Completion</h4>

<p>This is the last of what I'm calling the <i>Gauss Gun Trilogy</i>. You must complete the <i>Gauss Gun Components</i> task to aquire this task. You have a 24-hour game-time wait, so now is a good time to explore any part of the Zone that you haven't yet or do some optional tasks. Hog radios you when the wait is over. Go talk to Hog to get the Gauss Gun. I strongly recommend keeping it as it will come in handy at the end.</p>

<!--*******Ivan*******-->
<h3 id="trodnik">Meet with Ivan Trodnik</h3>

<p>Tell Ivan you have come to see him and he gives you the following tasks:</p>

<h4>Deactivate the Brain Scorcher</h4>

<p>Ivan gives you a serum that knocks you out and you wake up at the south end of Pripyat. Before you go, it's a good idea to stash everything. In Pripyat, stripe the dead of any weapons and ammo, then go to the Radar transition point and make your way up the road to Lab X-19. When you spawn in the lab, a timer starts at 6:00 and psi holograms start coming at you. The holograms cause damage, so shoot them if you can, or outrun them. You may encounter multiple Bloodsuckers and fighting them takes too much time. You can outrun them, but they follow you. Be sure to stop at the seconded coded door to pick up some ammo, grenades, and health packs. At some point you should have come across a document that mentioned the date of the original accident, 04-26-1986. This is the code for the door. If you don't have the code, the door should open without it. Drop the grenades as you sprint to the Brain Scorcher switch and hopefully take the Bloodsuckers out.</p>

<p>When you get to the Brain Scorcher switch and turn it off, you pass out, dream, and wake up with a new task, <i>Find Wish Granter</i> and you are now a member of Clear Sky. Ignore the Wish Granter task, fight your way past Monolith to get out of the lab and head back to the Great Swamp. There is no easy way to get there from Radar. My recommendation is Army Warehouses > Rostok > Garbage > Agroprom. Return to Ivan and tell him that you did as he asked to complete the task. Now check your PDA for the next task.</p>

<!--*******kruglov*******-->

<h3 id="kruglov">Meet with Kruglov</h3>

<p>Kruglov is a technician now and can give you optional tasks like the other techs. Tell Kruglov you have come to see him and he gives you the following tasks:</p>

<h4>Deactivate the Brain Scorcher<h4>

<p>This is a duplicate of the <a href="#trodnik">Ivan Trodnik</a> task, only you become a member of the Ecologist faction. After you exit the lab, go through Radar to Army Warehouses, and then to Dead City. Return to Kruglov and tell him that you did as he asked to complete the task. Now check your PDA for the next task.</p>

<!--*******Loki*******-->
<h3 id="loki">Meet with Loki</h3>

<p>Loki is the Freedom commander at Yanov Station. You can get to Jupiter from the Red Forest, Zaton, and Pipyat. Tell Loki you have come to see him and he gives you the following tasks:</p>

<h4>Freedom Assault</h4>

<p>The objective is to meet up with some Freedom fighters and attack a Monolith squad in the Jupiter Factory complex. Monolith comes from the back (southeast) of the complex and continue north through the front building. Freedom attacks from the west (between buildings). You can go with them or come in from the north to cut Monolith off. Return to Loki and tell him that you did as he asked to complete the task. Now check your PDA for the next task.</p>

<h4>Freedom Assult on Monolith</h4>

<p>Unlike the <a href="#lukash">Lukash</a> task, this takes you to the Zaton Ranger Station. Go northeast to the Zaton transition point, then down the hill to the swamp and up the other side to the Ranger Station. Your companions prefer to go down on the east side of the bridge and up the west side. If you don't stay with them there's a chance they will engage the enemy without you. Go through the open panel in the wall and into the back door. A Monolith squad is in the opposite end of the building and will engage when they see you. Use the machinery in the center of the room as cover and take them out. Return to Loki and tell him that you did as he asked to complete the task. Now check your PDA for the next task.</p>

<!--*******Lukash*******-->
<h3 id="lukash">Meet with Lukash</h3>

<p>Besides the traditional routes to the Army Warehouses by way of Rostok and Radar, you can also get there from the Truck Cemetary, Dead City, and Red Forest. Tell Lukash you have come to see him and he gives you the following tasks:</p>

<h4>Clear the Village</h4>

<p>Lukash gives you a companion to help you clear out a Monolith squad in the nearby Bloodsucker Village. There are more Freedom fights waiting to help you. Once the Monolith squad is down, return to Lukash and tell him that you did as he asked to complete the task. Now check your PDA for the next task.</p>

<h4>Defend the Barrier</h4>

<p>Head out of the warehouse complex and to the barrier at the first intersection. Monolith has a squad just ahead coming from at you from Radar. Take them out, return to Lukash and tell him that you did as he asked to complete the task. Now check your PDA for the next task.</p>

<h4>Freedom Assult on Monolith</h4>

<p>Lukash wants you to take on Monolith and gives you two fighters to escort. Unlike the <a href="#loki">Loki</a> task, this takes you to the Limansk Construction Site. You can give them orders or just head for the spot on your PDA in Limansk. Take the northwest transition point to Dead City, and then the north transition point to Limansk. Keep in mind that you are escorting Freedom members who have their own set of friends and enemies.</p>

<p>There is some radiation in and around the Construction Site. If you get this task early in the game (like I did) your only treatment might be some vodka. If that's the case, you should be able to take out the Monolith squad before hitting the bottle.</p>

<p>Lead the Freedom fighters up the hill and engage the Monolith squad of four. The next step in the task is to return for your reward. You can take as much time as you want to loot the dead and search for supplies. Then, go back to the Army Warehouses and tell Lukash that you did as he asked to complete the task. Now check your PDA for the next task.
</p>

<!--*******Nimble*******-->
<h3 id="nimble">Meet with Nimble</h3>

<p>Nimble is somewhat of a trader, but on a small scale. You can place an order through him for special equipment, but I never have. He stays in the southwest house of the Rookie Village. Tell Nimble you have come to see him and he gives you the following tasks:</p>

<h4>Infiltrate Lab X-18</h4>

<p>The shortest route to the lab is north to Garbage and the first transition point to Dark Valley along the east side of the map. In the lab, everything is pretty much the same as SOC: same mutants, same dead scientist with access codes, Pseudogiant, etc. One thing I found slightly different is when I approached the first coded door the mutants could actually get to me through the door. I was able to get a few head shots in with my pistol when my timing was right. Once you get to the bottom level, you have to take out the Pyrogeists, which I find relatively easy. Just use a shotgun and aim near the top of the thing. F1 grenades are efficient, too. Get to the bottom of the stairs where it spawns and take it out. The <i>Lab X-18 Documents</i> are on the desk between two monitors. Return to Nimble and tell him that you did as he asked to complete the task. Now check your PDA for the next task.</p>

<h4>Resue Missing Stalker</h4>

<p>A Stalker is being held captive and Nimble wants you to go get him. But it seems the location and faction are random. In my playthroughs it was Freedom in the Great Swamp Fishing Hamlet and Military in Cordon Abandoned Farmstead. The Stalker stays on his knees with hands behind his head until you talk to him. Now you must escort the Stalker back to the Rookie Village. Return to Nimble and tell him that you did as he asked to complete the task. Now check your PDA for the next task.</p>

<!--*******Olivius*******-->
<h3 id="olivius">Meet with Olivius</h3>

<p>You must have a neutral or friend relationship with Bandits to get tasks from Olivius. He is now the trader in the Bandit Base and located where Ashot was in CS. Tell Olivius you have come to see him and he gives you the following tasks:</p>

<h4>Bandit Backup</h4>

<p>Go south down the road to the lake and take out the Monolith squad. Return to Olivius and tell him that you did as he asked to complete the task. Now check your PDA for the next task.</p>

<!--*******Owl*******-->
<h3 id="owl">Meet with Owl</h3>

<p>Owl is still in the same place back in Zaton and hasn't lost one bit of his charm. He's also one of the few traders that takes mutant parts. The only way to get to Zaton is through the Abandoned Hospital by way of Limansk, or Jupiter by way of Pripyat. Unless you are near the Truck Cemetary, you're probably better off taking the Limansk route. Tell Owl you've come to see him and he gives you the following tasks:</p>

<h4>Open the Supply Line</h4>

<p>This task is similar to Beard's <i>Dangerous Mutant Extermination</i>. Located west of the Skadovsk near the Burnt Farmstead is a group of Bloodsuckers. The easiest way to deal with them is to loop around to the south and up onto the pipe line. Then, shoot at them to get there attention. You can lob a grenade or two as they approach, or just wait for them to come to you and blast them with a shotgun. Owl pays 250 RUs for Bloodsucker tentacles. Return to Owl and tell him that you did as he asked to complete the task. Now check your PDA for the next task.</p>

<!--*******Hermann*******-->
<h3 id="hermann">Meet with Professor Hermann</h3>

<p>You can get to Jupiter from the Red Forest, Zaton, and Pipyat. Tell Hermann you have come to see him and he gives you the following tasks:</p>

<h4>Investigate Stingray 1 Crash Site</h4>

<p>The site is the same as in COP, in the southwest corner of the Jupiter map. You still have to avoid the mines, but they are well marked. Look for the <i>Flight Plan</i> document on ground along the southwest side of the helicoper. As with COP, picking the document up triggers a stampede of Boars. I recommend going to the front of the helicoper and jumping on the gun nozzle, then continuing up as far as possible to kill any Boar that make it through the mine field. Return to Hermann and tell him that you did as he asked to complete the task. Now check your PDA for the next task.</p>

<h4>Search Jupiter Underground</h4>

<p>Hermann sends you to the Jupiter Underground to find some documents. The transition point is a door at the southeast corner of the room where you encountered two Burers in the COP optional mission from Trapper, <i>Hunting: Unidentified Mutants</i>. When you spawn in the underground, take note of where you're standing. You will need to return to this spot after you find the documents. Make your way to the large circular room and up to the control room on the left as you enter the room. Just before reaching the control room there are two desks on the right, one turned over and the other upright. Search the upright desk for a blue folder, <i>Emitter Project Documents</i>. Return to Hermann and tell him that you did as he asked to complete the task. Now check your PDA for the next task.</p>

<h4>Site Preperation</h4>

<p>Hermann wants you to go to the Mining Complex in Red Forest to clear out a Monolith squad. Go southeast toward the Jupiter Factory and south down the road through the retaining pond. Continue through the gate and past the building on the left. Turn left (east) to find the transition point to Red Forest. There is a large tree that provides good cover for you to snipe the Monolith troops. Once you get an update to collect your reward, you can loot them if you want, or explore the Red Forest. Return to Hermann and tell him that you did as he asked to complete the task. Now check your PDA for the next task.</p>

<!--*******Sakharov*******-->
<h3 id="sakharov">Meet with Professor Sakharov</h3>

<p>Sometimes when you approach the mobile lab in Yantar you can see Sakharov walking outside, but then he heads for the door when he sees you coming. Tell Sakharov you have come to see him and he gives you the following tasks:</p>

<h4>Find artifact Sample</h4>

<p>The best part of this task is that Sakharov gives you a Svarog detector to find an artifact. Now you have to use it to search each anomaly in the area that produces the artifact Sakharov is looking for. For example, Burner anomalies for Mama's Beads, Electro anomalies for Snowflake, etc. Return to Sakharov with the artifact and tell him that you did as he asked to complete the task. Now check your PDA for the next task.</p>

<h4>Remove from Premises</h4>

<p>Sakharov ask you to convince a Monolith squad to vacate the area where he wants to do some research. These appear to be random locations, such as the bridge in Limansk and the Barrier in Army Warehouses. This is a solo task, so go, kill, and return for your reward. Now check your PDA for the next task.</p>

<!--*******Sidorovich*******-->
<h3 id="sid1">Meet with Sidorovich</h3>

<p>If you play the game as a Loner, this is probably your first task. You start the game in one of the Rookie Village root cellars and must go to Sidorovich's bunker. If you don't know how to get to Cordon, you shouldn't be playing this game. Tell him you're looking for Wish Granter and he gives you a list of contacts with your next task. When you return later in the game, tell him you've come to see him and he gives you the following tasks:</p>

<h4>Disable the Miracle Machine</h4>

<p>This is the Lab X-16 task from SOC. Recommended weaponry for this task is shotgun for Snorks, assault/sniper rifle for Zombies, and RPG/grenade launcher for Controller and possibly a Burer. For this task, Sidorovich gives you a Psi Helmet, which allows you to enter the lab, but also Pripyat. The shortest route is through Agroprom by way of either Garbage or Great Swamp. Use the northwest transition point to Yantar, continue north to where you met Lefty in CS. Turn the three terminals off and throw the main switch, just as before. Then, take out the Controller and exit through the underground. Return to Sidorovich and tell him that you did as he asked to complete the task. Now check your PDA for the next task.</p>

<h4>Find Doc</h4>

<p>After about 15-25 game-time days, Sidorovich offers to help you find the Wish Granter and tells you about Doc. This is where the storyline part of the game begins. At this point it is a one-way trip. Unless you plan to freeplay, you should bring everything you need. You will face the usual Monolith resistance going through the Sarcophagus and Monolith Control Room, as well as a Controller, Bloodsucker, Poltergeists, and Pyrogeists. I recommend an SVD or Gauss, an assault rifle, and something for the mutants, like a shotgun.</p>

<p>As with previous tasks when you needed to find someone, ask around to get a better idea where Doc might be. You may have already seen him wondering around the Great Swamp. Eventually, Doc shows up on your PDA so you can track him down. Maybe you need to get within a certain radius or something? Anyway, Doc sends you to <a href="#hotel">Hotel Polissya</a> in Pripyat.</p>

<h4>Recover Hijacked Supply Shipment</h4>

<p>This task is about catching up to some Bandits and getting Sid's stuff back. So, lighted your inventory, but keep your energy drinks. Also, the shipment weights 12 kg, so there's that, too. Find the Bandits and put them down. Grab the <i>Locked Case</i>, return to Sidorovich, and tell him that you did as he asked to complete the task. Now check your PDA for the next task.</p>

<h4>Thread the Needle</h4>

<p>Similar to <a href="#barkeep">Barkeep's Bounty</a> and <a href="#cold">Kill the Profiteer</a>, you must take out the target without involving anyone else. This task takes you to the Army Warehouses to take out a Loner without injuring his companions. For this, you must get close enough to tell which one is which, but not to alert them as they will all start shooting at you. The target is in the southeast farmstead of the Bloodsucker Village. You can enter the house to the west without detection and use it for cover. You should be able to see the Loner through a window, get a head shot, and get to the nearest transition point without too much trouble. Return to Sidorovich and tell him that you did as he asked to complete the task. Now check your PDA for the next task.</p>

<!--*******Skinflint*******-->
<h3 id="skinflint">Meet with Skinflint</h3>

<p>Skinflint is a trader on the Freedom base in Army Warehouses. Tell Skinflint you have come to see him and he gives you the following tasks:</p>

<h4>Kill the Puppet Master</h4>

<p>There is no known location from Skinflint, so you have to ask around. Talk to someone and tell them you are looking for someone. They tell you to look in Red Forest. There is a transition point along the north edge of Army Warehouse that puts you in the southwest corner of Red Forest. After a few minutes you get a message giving you the approximate location of your target, probably the Mining Complex near the forest gate. Take out the target and any friends of his that might want in on the action, return to Skinflint, and tell him that you did as he asked to complete the task. Now check your PDA for the next task.</p>

<!--*******Spore*******-->
<h3 id="spore">Meet with Spore</h3>

<p>Spore is now the trader in the Clear Sky camp. The traditional routes to the Great Swamp are available, being Cordon south of the Rookie Village and west of the Railroad Bridge on the north side of the tracks, as well as Agroprom southeast of the institute. Once you're at the Great Swamp, go south of the Fishing Hamlet, through the hole in the fence, and to the Cleak Sky base.Tell Spore you have come to see him and he gives you the following tasks:</p>

<h4>Infiltrate Lab X-18</h4>

<p>See <a href="#nimble">Nimble</a>.</p>

<h4>Reinforce Clear Sky</h4>

<p>This is a two-step task where you meet up with a Clear Sky squad and then attack a nearby Monolith squad. For me, the Monolith squad was north of the Burnt Farmstead with Clear Sky southwest of them. If this is the case, move east to some boulders that you can use as cover and snipe Monolith from the south. Return to Spore and tell him that you did as he asked to complete the task. Now check your PDA for the next task.</p>

<h4>Rescue Clear Sky Operative</h4>

<p>Head to Garbage by way of Agroprom or Cordon and take out the Duty squad holding the operative. Escort him back to Spore and tell him that you did as he asked to complete the task. Now check your PDA for the next task.</p>

<!--*******Xenotech*******-->
<h3 id="xenotech">Meet with Xenotech</h3>

<p>Xenotech has taken Van's place as the technician at the Northern Farmstead. Tell Xenotech you have come to see him and he gives you the following tasks:</p>

<h4>Resue Missing Stalker</h4>

<p>Your target is the Southern Farmstead in the Great Swamp, which you can get to by either transition points in the Cordon. The Stalker is being held captive by a Monolith squad. Once you take them out, talk to the Stalker and lead him back to Xenotech. Tell Xenotech that you did as he asked to complete the task. Now check your PDA for the next task.</p>

<h4>Executioner</h4>

<p>Xenotect sends you to the southern part of Darkscape to take out someone with a bounty on their head. You can get there by the transition point on the east side of the Cordon map. There are some boulders to the west of the encampment that you can use for cover. Just be aware that he may not be alone. Once he's down, return to Xenotech and tell him that you did as he asked to complete the task. Now check your PDA for the next task.</p>

<h4>Stop the Cordon Killers</h4>

<p>There's a couple of Bandits camped east of the Abandoned Farmstead that you need to take out. Return to Xenotech and tell him that you did as he asked to complete the task. Now check your PDA for the next task.</p>

<!--*******Storyline*******-->
<h3 id="storyline">Storyline</h3>

<h4 id="hotel">Hotel Polissya</h4>

<p>You get this task from Doc in the Great Swamp. The shortest route to Pripyat is through Army Warehouses > Radar. There are a number of ways to get to Army Warehouses from the Great Swamp. It just depends on your relationship with Duty as to whether you can pass through Rostok or go around, such as Agroprom > Yantar > Dead City. However you go, there aren't nearly as many Monolith as in SOC and getting to the hotel is fairly simple. Same room as before (26). But before you go up stairs, check the ground floor in the area marked on your PDA. There's a known bug where the items fall through the floor. You need to find the decoder and the <i>Stalker Diary</i> document. If not on the ground floor, check room 26. When you have both items the task is complete and you get <i>Search the Reactor Control Room</i>.</p>

<h4 id="search">Search the Reactor Control Room</h4>

<p>You get this task by completing the <i>Hotel Polissya</i> task. Head through the stadium to CNPP. There's light resistance until you get to the Sarcophagus transition point. However, in the Sarcophagus map, the usual Monolith forces are in place. Make your way through the Sarcophagus and use the decoder to open the door to Monolith Control Center. Again, the same level of resistance. When you have cleared the control center, which is the last room before the one with the crystals, go up on the elevated platform and turn left to find the <i>Order of Transfer</i> document on top of the control panel. Pick it up to complete the task and get <i>Find the Hidden Lab</i>.

<h4 id="hidden">Find the Hidden Lab</h4>

<p>Go through the room with the crystals and up the stairs to spawn on the north side of CNPP. Your objective is the Generators transition point in the northeast corner of the map. As you make your way, watch for snipers. I recommend going north to the train tracks and following those to the road that goes north to the transition point. In Generators, go east to the complex. There may be a Monolith squad to clear out before you can enter the center building. The transition point takes you to the Monolith War Lab, which is the same map as Lab X-8 in Outskirts. At this point, the only weapons you need are a shotgun and Gauss/sniper rifle. Here's the walkthrough:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Use the code from the <i>Order of Transfer</i> document to open the door.</li>
	<li>Go through the doorway with the test tube and beaker sign, and down the steps.</li>
	<li>Cross the room and turn left to find a ladder down.</li>
	<li>Follow the passage to the large room with a sunken floor. Notice the door guarded by two Poltergeists.</li>
	<li>Use the shotgun to take out the Poltergeists. Aim just above the center of the glow.</li>
	<li>Walk up to the door and try to open it. This gives you <i>Find Access Card</i> with two possible locations. If you don't try to open the door, you won't find the card. Trust me.
		<ol>
			<li>Turn around and go through the next doorway to the elevators.</li>
			<li>Wait for the Controller to come through one of the two doorways to the elevators and kill it.</li>
			<li>Proceed to the elevators.</li>
			<li>Go into the shaft without the Fruit Punch anomaly and climb the ladder to the next open door.</li>
			<li>Walk off the ladder to the open door. This may take a few tries. Go up past the third rung, turn slightly toward the door, hold down the walk key (default Shift), and use the forward (default W) and right (default D) to walk of the ladder onto the floor.</li>
			<li>Follow the passage around to the left. At some point you should encounter a Controller.</li>
			<li>Continue taking left turns until you come to some metal steps on the right.</li>
			<li>Go up the steps and into the next room. Check the table for the card. If it's not there, backtrack down to the bottom of the elevator shaft.</li>
			<li>Go back to through the passage with the Fruit Punch anomaly and up the ladder toward the starting point.</li>
			<li>Go through the doorway with the man on the sign and down the steps in the next room.</li>
			<li>Turn around and go under the platform to the ladder going down. At some point you will encounter a Bloodsucker.</li>
			<li>Follow the passage to another passage with shelves, control panels, and a work station.</li>
			<li>Search the selves and work station for the card. If you still can't find it, you may need to start the level over again. This happened to me during my second playthrough.</li>
			<li>Now back up the ladder and retrace your steps to the locked door.</li>
		</ol>
	</li>
	<li>Open the door, follow the passageway to the next locked door.</li>
	<li>Press the action key (default F) to activate the decoder.</li>
</ol>

<p>When the door opens you pass out and a cutscene plays. When you wake up you have no tasks other than <i>Find Wish Granter</i>. Before you step up to the hologram, put the Guass/sniper rifle in one weapon slot and shotgun in the other. Then step through the door to initiate a coversation with the hologram. Click through the dialog and make your choice whether to join or not. If not, you get <i>Destroy the Generators</i>.</p>

<h4 id="destroy">Destroy the Generators</h4>

<p>The best spot to complete this task is right where you are, just inside the door. There is some sort of tube in front of you where hologram Monolith decend every five seconds. The objective is to destroy the six crystals, then go to the far side of the room and throw the switch to turn off the generators. Use the Gauss to take out each hologram as it decends. In between, take out a crystal or reload the Gauss. Don't let any holograms get in a position to fire on you. Take them out as soon as you can. With each crystal destroyed a Pyrogeist spawns. Use the shotgun on them as they come by your position. With all crystals destroyed, and you may need to move to one side to get the last one, sprint to the other side of the room and throw the switch on the control board. That's it. I hope you enjoyed yourself. After the cutscene you spawn back outside the lab and can freeplay.</p>
