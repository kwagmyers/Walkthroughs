<h1>S.T.A.L.K.E.R. Lost Alpha</h1>
<h2>Storyline Walkthrough</h2>
<p>This walkthrough is based on Lost Alpha version 1.4005 Developer's Cut (build 6890) played at Master level and includes optional tasks unique to the mod (as far as I know). There are some tasks that I had trouble with, characters wouldn't offer, bugs, etc. So, this is very much a work in progress.</p>

<h2 id="Alex">Alex</h2>
<h3 id="Help-the-forgotten-stalker-trader">Help the forgotten stalker trader</h3>
<p>Alex is a trader at the Construction Site, but is not indicated as a trader on your map. His shop is in a white two-story building about halfway along the south road with two loners guarding the front door. Go in and open the first door on the left and talk to Alex. At first, he warns you about the Merc bar. But eventually, he gets around to giving you the task. As you leave the building and get back to the south road, take a slight right turn and cross the road to go along a dirt drive between some large trees. Go through the gate and into the building on the left. The box of nuts is on the floor along the north wall.</p>

<p>The bandit camp Alex suggested is located in a wooded area northwest of the building with the box of nuts. If you have trouble finding it, go to the bus stop west of where you are, then to the third telephone pole north and turn east. The camp is usually being attacked by unarmed zombies, so you should be able to hear gunfire as you approach. With the area clear, go into the root cellar and grab the box of transistors on the table. When you get back to Alex, he gives you the password to the Merc bar to end the task. The password is needed for the <a href="Find-the-Gauss-rifle">Find the Gauss rifle</a> task. Ask him all the questions you have before you can ask for the next task, which is the <a href="#Help-destroy-the-fuel-cache">Help destroy the fuel cache</a></p>

<h3 id="Help-destroy-the-fuel-cache">Help destroy the fuel cache</h3>
<p>The target is in the southeast area of Darkscape. There's a couple of ways to get there from the Construction Site. Yantar &#gt; Great Metal Factory &#gt; Forest &#gt; Dark Valley, or, Great Metal Factory &#gt; Garbage &#gt; Dark Valley seem to be the most direct. I prefer the Yantar route simply because you avoid the bandits and going through the construction site of the Great Metal Factory. If you have an Elite Anomaly Detector and a good suit, the Forest isn't too bad (slow and steady wins the race). If you don't have an EAD, there's one in the west room of the house on the hill southwest of the targeted Merc base (for the trip back to Alex).</p>

<p>As you drive south through Darkscape, there's a large crane on the left where the Merc base is. Go past the base to the intersection, turn left, park by the truck, and take out your sniper rifle. Use the trees as cover, but avoid the large storage tanks as they are radiated. There's usually a guard at the back door that you can take out, which alerts the others to your position. Generally, there's six Mercs in the building and three more along the dock, either on the dock or on the beach. When you've cleared the building, climb up the ladder on the east wall near the southeast corner. Pick up the RPG launcher and four rockets are near the center of the roof. Turn east and put your site on the large ship in the distance. You can just make out the barrels on top of the cabin, left of the smoke stacks. You know if you hit them if you get a task update to return to Alex. If you need help with the move point from the Great Metal Factory to Yantar, see <a href="#Talk-with-the-scientist-in-Yantar">Talk with the scientist in Yantar</a> for instructions. Alex gives you 6000 RUs to end the task.</p>

<!--****Dima****-->
<h2 id="Dima">Dima</h2>
<h3 id="Help-Duty-reclaim-their-HQ">Help Duty reclaim their HQ</h3>
<p>You get this task as you enter Rostok, and navigating the streets of Rostok is a bit tricky with the anomalies, blocked railroad crossings, etc. As you enter the town, follow the road to the first railroad crossing, turn right onto the second set of tracks and stay left at the fork. Turn right to get back on the road at the next crossing, right again (north) before the bus stop with the burning barrel, and to the end of the street. Dima is to the left, but parking the car near his position can cause issues with the Dutyers walking around. So, park off the road in front of the red brick building ruins and go talk to Dima, who gives you a gas mask.</p>

<p>After talking with Dima, arm yourself for bloodsucker battle, go back down (south) the street you just came from and make a jog to the left to get to the gate of the factory complex. The gate is just open enough to get the Lada through, but for now, it's best to park outside. As you enter the gate, a cut-scene plays with you finding the first corpse. When it ends, you battle the first of four bloodsuckers. Put it down and go south, turn right at the intersection and left where the wall ends to go into the unfinished building. The first floor is divided in half with a set of stairs in the southeast corner of the north half. Go up to the second floor, to the stairs in either corner of the west side of the building and up to the third floor. Facing north, there is a long partition with a burning barrel on the right (east). The next corpse is on the other side of the long partion and when you pick up the PDA, the next bloodsucker spawns on the west side of the partion. When it's down, go to the stairs in the center of the east side and go up to the forth floor. The third corpse is in the northeast corner and, again, when you pick up the PDA another bloodsucker spawns.</p>

<p>Now leave the building the way you came in, turn left (west), another left at the intersection, and right to go through the passageway with the burning barrel. Left at the intersection and you should be facing south with the gas-filled building in front of you. This is a good place to save because the gas mask Dima gave you only lasts for three minutes and it might take a few tries to get this next bit. Double-click the gas mask in your inventory, go into the building and turn left to go up the stairs. Stay along the left wall as you move west to get to the last corpse, which is in the southwest corner of a lobby area. Take his PDA and continue west where the last bloodsucker is waiting. Put it down quickly before it runs off or you'll waste a lot of time tracking it down. Use the stairs on the north wall to go up two more levels to the roof. Turn left after the doorway and drop down into the hole, but be sure to only drop one level. Go to the safe in the northwest corner and put in the combination from the PDA you just picked up, 2-3-4-3. Take the contents and leave the room through the door in the center of the south wall that is now open. Turn right, down the stairs to the first floor and north out the front door. Report back to Dima and he gives you the <a href="#Access-the-lab-and-kill-the-bloodsuckers">Access the lab and kill the bloodsuckers</a> task.</p>

<h3 id="Access-the-lab-and-kill-the-bloodsuckers">Access the lab and kill the bloodsuckers</h3>
<p>This task takes place in the X-14 lab and is simultaneously completed with the <a href="#Find-the-documents-for-Sin">Find the documents for Sin</a> task. Starting from Dima's location at the north end of the town, go back to the passageway with the buring barrel and turn right this time. Go north to the end of the fence on the left, u-turn left to follow the road around and turn right (north) at the intersection to face a closed metal gate. Approach the gate and press action to open it, then continue north to move into the lab.</p>

<p>The boxes that block the doorway are empty, so you can break them down or just push them out of the way. In fact, I think all of the boxes in this lab are empty. Several rats come to greet you, so once you take care of them, turn left (east) and battle with the bloodsucker in the room on the right. You can go west to explore if you want, but you'll only find some unarmed zombies. Back to the hallway and east again to the end, turn right and find another bloodsucker in the room on the left. Continue south, then right turn west to the second room on the left with the first dead scientist. His PDA gives you a door code, which is listed in your PDA's Log and Message history. Go to the end of the hallway and turn right to find another dead scientist on the left, and then to the end of the hallway where there's a security door. Enter the code you got from the first scientist, 4-5-2-6, and open the door to find another bloodsucker. Continue to the intersection and turn right (east) to the next security door, where you must enter the same code. Open the door to find a stack of boxes in the way. As you step through the doorway, a brief cut-scene plays. Now continue east through the doorway to find another bloodsucker. North of the doorway and against the wall is a desk with the Scientist PDA and a red-covered Document required for the <a href="#Find-the-documents-for-Sin">Find the documents for Sin</a> task.</p>

<p>Exit the room through the doorway on the east to another security door that doesn't require a code. Open the door to find and kill the final bloodsucker to complete the task. Now backtrack west through the room with the desk and to the end of the hallway, turn left and go to the end three times. The forth left turn comes just before the doorway blocked by a cave-in, then into the room on the right to move out of the lab. Dima is, by now, on the top floor of the unfinished building where you killed the second and third bloodsucker. However, he doesn't offer any more tasks.</p>

<!--****Griboyedov****-->
<h2 id="Griboyedov">Griboyedov</h2>

<p>One advantage to working for Griboyedov is that he pays you up front.</p>

<h3 id="A-petty-thief">A petty thief</h3>
<p>You meet Griboyedov in the Countryside during the <a href="LostAlpha.html#Find-the-underground-tunnels-at-the-waterdam" target="_blank">Find the underground tunnels at the waterdam</a> task. If you ask him for a job, he tells you of a karlik that he'd like to be rid of and return a gun the karlik has. When you meet Griboyedov, you are most likely walking. However, the jeep at the west end of the base is in working order(even though parts fall of when you get in). You can take a direct route, or follow the road to the dirt turn-off. Just be aware that the jeep is very top-heavy and rolls easily. When you get to the church, the karlik is in the building next to it. Put a couple of rounds in its head, but if you search it, DO NOT CLICK TAKE ALL as that will crash the game (at least it does on mine - even just taking the Jellyfish can do it). Loot the house and find the <i>Registered Fort-12</i> in the southwest corner of the southwest room. When you return to Griboyedov, give him the gun and he gives you 4500 RUz. You have to close out the dialog and open it again to ask Griboyedov about the next job, <a href="#Cleaning2">Cleaning</a>. You also get a Groza and some ammo to go with it.

<h3 id="Cleaning2">Cleaning - Fleshes</h3>
<p>Griboyedov's version of cleaning takes place just south of the base, and there are a few more fleshes this time. When you finish them off, Griboyedov radios that there are more to the west (actually, northwest). There's seven or eight fleshes in each herd, but sometimes a herd of boar will decide to join in. When you report back to Griboyedov, tell him, "I did it." and he gives you 7000 RUz. The next job is another cleaning, this time psy dogs.</p>

<h3 id="Cleaning3">Cleaning Psy Dogs</h3>
<p>For this task you get a soldier suit, more ammo for the Groza, along with a few grenades for the Groza, too. The location is near the entrance to the underground tunnels that Hermit tells you about, so this task can be performed at the same time as the <a href="LostAlpha.html#Find-another-way-into-the-underground" target="_blank">Find another way into the underground</a> task. The grenades are nice, but I prefer and RPG or two. There's a pile of boulders to the west of the underground entrance that Hermit gives you. Climb as high as you can and get to the western-most boulder (high enough that the dogs can't get you. You should be able to see them circling around on the other side of the large tree. Concentrate your fire there and when you get an on-screen message to report on your progress, you know you've got them all. Report back and the next job is the <a href="#Cleaning4">Cleaning Chimeras</a> task.</p>

<h3 id="Cleaning4">Cleaning Chimeras</h3>
<p><b>NOTE:</b> This task requires you to go to the "tunnel" at night to take care of a chimera that is "blocking communications by the main road." I went to the tunnel about 22:30, cleared out the two bandits hanging around the truck, and waited until after 24:00. After each half-hour I checked both ends of the tunnel, but no Chimera. Some bandits started moving in about 00:15 and I was getting very sleepy, so I went somewhere safe for an hour-long nap. When I came back, the bandits were still there, so I'm assuming there still was no chimera. So, I'm calling this one a bust...or maybe a bug.</p>

<!--****Hunter****-->
<h2 id="Hunter">Hunter</h2>
<h3 id="Find-the-stolen-rifle-and-return-it-to-Hunter">Find the stolen rifle and return it to Hunter</h3> 
<p>You gain this task by talking to Hunter in the Rads Bar at the Great Metal Factory location. If you have a car (which comes after the <i>Retrieve information about X18</i> task), you can just drive to the contruction site and avoid the mutants. Otherwise, starting from the bar, or rather, the northern gate, go west to the end of the elevated pipes on the right. There's a pack of blind dogs and psuedodogs ahead and you need a safe place to pick them off from. You're going to pick up some radiation, so keep moving. Sprint to the cement slabs and jump on top, then to the awning northeast of the slabs. Once you are on the awning, you can take some antirad if necessary. Next to the trailer roof and you can pick them off in safety from there.</p>

<p>Next, there's a controller at the west end of the road, probably fighting with some other mutants. Go through the open gate and into the back of the blue truck on the left. You should be able to shoot the red barrels and hopefully take out some mutants. The controller can't get you from where you are, so keep firing until it's down. There are still some mutants around, so keep your guard up as you make your way south. Into the first building on the left and up the stairs to the catwalk. Go to the south end where it's broken off and wait for the snorks. Once they're taken out, move to the open door on the west wall at the south end of the building. Around the corner are two more psuedodogs, but they don't come into the building, so you can use it as a safe retreat.</p>

<p>You should be able to go from this point back to the bar in relative safety with those mutants out of the way. There are two groups of bandits, however. One group is on the west side and the other group is south of the construction site. This second group has Hunter's gun. There are five bandits in this group, and at least one is guarding the open area east of their camp. If you have a good sniper rifle, you can pick one or two off from the construction site. Another spot is to stand on the hand rail of the catwalk southwest of the contruction site. But you are exposed to any fire coming from the east. The BM16 Rifle, a.k.a. shotgun, is on the sofa in the northeast corner of the camp. Take the gun back to the bar and give it to Hunter to complete the task and he gives you 2000 RU.</p>

<!--****Kruglov****-->
<h2 id="Kruglov">Kruglov</h2>
<h3 id="Find-something-of-the-dead-composer">Find something of the dead composer</h3>
<p>When you return to Yantar with the Crystal artifact to complete the <a href="LostAlpha.html#Return-the-artefact-to-Sakharov" target="_blank">Return the artefact to Sakharov</a> task, Sakhorov tells you to talk to Kruglov while you wait for him to fix your PDA. Ask Kruglov if he has any special tasks and he asks you to retreave some sheet music from the Forest. From Yantar, the shortest way to the Forest is through the Great Metal Factory. When you leave the mobile lab compound (assuming you're driving), go south of the pipe that comes out of the ground and turn east, pass the tug boat on the south side and stay close to the wall of the other compound to avoid anomalies. Past the green trailer and turn east toward the enclosure near the move point. Drive into the opening on the west side and turn left as you start up the ramp to come off the ramp and proceed to the move point.</p>

<p>When you spawn at the factory, continue east past the train cars and turn southeast to power your way over the tracks. You've probably been this way already, but just to be thorough, when you get back on hard surface, turn east, around the trailer and through the gate. When you get to the end of the chain-link fence on the right, turn southeast to go south of the dumpster and through the bushes to get around the construction materials that block the road. When you emerge from the bushes, you are probably on the right side of a boulevard. Go east to the end, follow it around to continue east and turn right at the intersection. Go to the end of the street and turn left. As you pass the bus, the road jogs to the left and there's an anomaly on the right, so stay against the left curb. At the end of the street, turn right, pass the dump truck, and turn left to the move point.</p>

<p>In the Forest, turn right at the first intersection and stop at the bus stop on the right. There are a few unarmed zombies, so a pistol is all you need. You can either drive or walk (it's not far) northeast to the village and to the house at the northeast end. Inside, go to the northeast room where there's a piano in the southeast corner. The sheet music is on the floor in front of the piano. Now back to Yantar by way of the Great Metal Factory. If you haven't used the move point from the factory to Yantar, see my instructions under <a href="LostAlpha.html#Talk-with-the-scientist-in-Yantar" target="_blank">Talk with the scientist in Yantar</a>. Talk to Kruglov about the composer's house to complete the task.</p>

<!--****Milo****-->
<h2 id="Milo">Milo</h2>
<h3 id="Find-the-Gauss-rifle">Find the Gauss rifle</h3>
<p>To get this task, you must first complete the <a href="#Help-the-forgotten-stalker-trader">Help the forgotten stalker trader</a> task. Milo is located in the quonset hut at the south end of the Construction Site Merc base. Ask him for a job and he gives you this task, which sends you back to the Merc base in Darkscape. Now the Mercs in the building have respawned, but you don't need to engage them. Instead, approach the barge from the north, go in the door on the west side near the stern, left through the doorway and up the stairs, turn left again and follow the deck around to the stern. Turn and face the bow to see a doorway to the cabin at the bottom of another set of stairs. Inside, to the left, are some shelves with the Gauss. Pick it up to get a task update and return to the Construction Site, where Milo gives you 15,000 RUs to complete the task. Ask him for another job and he gives you the <a href="#Find-the-Gauss-box">Find the Gauss box</a> task.</p>

<h3 id="Find-the-Gauss-box">Find the Gauss box</h3>
<p>The box is located in the Monolith base in Radar and I suggest you wait until you've completed the <a href="#Nomad's-belongings">Nomad's belongings</a> task. Getting to the base is pretty straight forward, with some cross-country driving in Yantar. From the Merc base, go to Yantar and turn right. Follow the road, turning left at the intersection, until you get to the high-tension wire tower near the end, but don't pass it. Turn right and go over the pipe so you end up between it and the fence. Continue north and stay to the right along the bluff, following it around to the move point to the Dead City. Continue north to the Radar move point.</p>

<p>Depending on where you are in the game, there may be Monolith guards at the spawn point in Radar. Quickly drive up to the bus at the next intersection and use it for cover to take them out. You may also have some come in from the west. If the Lada is still there, you can use it to save some of your petrol. Follow the road north to the left curve and, unless you've already completed the <a href="#Nomad's-belongings">Nomad's belongings</a> task, you're going to have some more Monolith to deal with. Otherwise, just continue on into the base.</p>

<p>Go through the gate that is north of the road you came in on and pull up to the building on the left. Go in the front door and turn left. The box is on the floor in the second room on the left. Take it back to Milo and he gives you 16,000 RUs to complete the task.</p>

<!--****Nimble****-->
<h2 id="Nimble">Nimble</h2>
<p>Nimble offers two types of task, "I need a job. Do you have something for me?" and what I will call "What's next" (the question you ask Nimble changes for these as you progress). When working for Nimble, it's always good to check his location when returning with a requested item. He likes to move around, even within the Rookie Village he will move from house to house.</p>
 
<h3>I need a job. Do you have something for me?</h3>
<h4 id="Find-the-Groza">Find the Groza</h4>
<p>When Nimble finds his place in the northeast house of the Rookie Village, you can ask him about his business plan to get this task. The task takes place at the Agroprom Research Institute and can be completed without firing a shot during the <a href="LostAlpha.html#Find-the-militaries'-documents" target="_blank">Find the militaries' documents</a> task. However, you can complete both these tasks along with the <i>Find the documents (Agroprom)</i> task. Either way, take the gun to Nimble and give it to him, even though he can't pay you, to complete the task. Nimble then asks, "So what about the next task?" If you select "I don't mind working some more. What's next?" he gives you the <a href="#Find-improved-Viper-5">Find improved "Viper 5"</a> task. Also, Nimble says he knows a place to hide the Groza and asks if you want to go with him. If you say, "Yes..." he just goes out the front door, stops, and stands there looking at you for a while. Then he goes back to the underground using the entrance under the road where he came out. Then, down the steps into a room with boxes and crates where he hides the gun. Again, he turns and just looks at you.</p>

<h4 id="Find-improved-Viper-5">Find improved "Viper 5"</h4>
<p>You must first complete the <a href="#Find-the-Groza">Find the Groza</a> task to be able to ask Nimble about his task. This is a simple matter of going up the road to the bus that's just south of the move point to the Garbage. On the ground, just below the front door, is the Viper 5. You may need to low-crouch and turn your headlamp on to see it. Grab it and take it back to Nimble, who still can't pay you for the Groza, but gives you 5000 RU for the Viper 5. At this point, you can ask Nimble "<a href="#What's-next">What's next?"</a> and he gives you the <a href="#Find-the-revolver">Find the revolver</a> task, which you can do during the <i>Find the bandits' documents</i> task of the storyline. You can also ask him, "I need a job. Do you have something for me?" and he gives you the <a href="#Find-anomaly-jacket">Find anomaly jacket</a>, which is in the Garbage near the hanger.

<h4 id="Find-anomaly-jacket">Find anomaly jacket</h4>
<p>This is the third in a series of optional tasks given by Nimble and you must complete the first two in order to unlock this task. The location of the item is inside a fenced-in area where a stalker met his end in an anomaly. You have to find a way into the area and get his jacket without falling to the same anomaly. On the east side of the road across from the hanger where you met Seriy, is the Lost Alpha version of the Vehicle Graveyard. And in the southeast corner is a smaller fenced-in area where the jacket is waiting.</p>

<p>Starting from the road, go to the south end of the long fence and along the south fence until it ends. In front of you (east) is a helicopter inside another fence. Go to the left of the helicopter to where you can see the stalker guarded by a Witches' Jelly anomaly. There's a spot on the bluff at the end of the fence that you can jump up on to get around the fence. I don't know of a way to get this item without taking some damage, and this seems to be the shortest/less damaging way. There may be an artifact nearby that will help reduce the damage, too. Don't try to ease in, just get to the corpse, search, take all, and get back out. Now, depending on your suit, you're going to need multiple bandages. Now, once the bleeding stops, sprint south along the bluff to get out.</p>

<p>Take the jacket back to Nimble and he pays you a Jellyfish artifact to complete the task, but still can't pay you for the Groza. Ask him for another job and he offers the <a href="#Find-Duty-hunter-PS5-suit">Find Duty hunter PS5 suit</a>, which is at the Great Metal Factory.</p>

<h4 id="Find-Duty-hunter-PS5-suit">Find Duty hunter PS5 suit</h4>

<p><b>NOTE:</b> The easiest way to get this item is to wait until you have a car, which protects you from the mutants (as long as they don't push the car on its side). You can just drive up to the BTR, jump out, grab the suit, and jump back in before the wildlife gets to you. But if you want to do this the hard way, here ya go. Plus, these mutants don't respawn and once you clear the way, you don't have to deal with them anymore, even in free-play.</p>

<p>This is the forth in a series of optional tasks given by Nimble and you must complete the preceeding tasks in order to unlock this task. Since this is the same area as the <a href="#Find-the-stolen-rifle-and-return-it-to-Hunter">Find the stolen rifle and return it to Hunter</a> task, you may want to stop in at the bar and talk to Hunter so you can do both tasks at once. Either way, use the first two paragraphs of the Hunter task to get to the location.</p>

<p>Go east between the building with the catwalk and the building south of it, to the BTR. The suit can be reached through the door on the far side. Take the suit back to Nimble and he pays you 9500 RU and a medkit to complete the task. Nimble can now pay you 7500 RU for the Groza, and if you ask him for another job, he gives you the <a href="Find-mercenaries'-improved-outfit">Find mercenaries' improved outfit</a>

<h4 id="Find-mercenaries'-improved-outfit">Find mercenaries' improved outfit</h4>
<p>This is the fifth in a series of optional tasks given by Nimble and you must complete the preceeding tasks in order to unlock this task. The item is in the Dark Valley, south of the Monolith base. The suit, along with some supplies, is in a green trailer which sits in a hollow and is surrounded by anomalies. There are burner anomalies inside the trailer as well. Be sure you have either a scientific or military medkit in you backpack and start from the southwest side facing the door. You can't sprint when you're close to the trailer because of the anomalies. Open the door and stay along the right wall, taking your medkit as you walk to the back (northeast) end of the trailer. Pick up everything and get out the same way. Tell Nimble you are here for the job and he pays you 4000 RU for the suit. Now tell him you need a job and he gives you the <a href="#Find-soldiers'-healing-suit">Find soldiers' healing suit</a> task.</p>

<h4 id="Find-soldiers'-healing-suit">Find soldiers' healing suit</h4>
<p>This item is in the Countryside and can be collected during the <a href="LostAlpha.html#Find-the-underground-tunnels-at-the-waterdam" target="_blank">Find the underground tunnels at the waterdam</a> task. The suit is in a cement-lined canal that runs north and south through the center of the Countryside. The hardest part is avoiding the anomalies, but it's just a matter of walking down the ramp and picking it up on the northwest corner of the cement platform. Take it back to to Nimble by way of Radar, Army Warehouses, Great Metal Factory, Garbage, Cordon. Or, wait for a more opportune time. He gives you 6000 RUz to complete the task, but has no other jobs for you.</p>

<h3 id="What's-next">What's next</h3>
<h4 id="Find-the-revolver">Find the revolver</h4>
See <a href="#Find-improved-Viper-5">Find improved "Viper 5"</a> to unlock these tasks. Ask Nimble, "What's next?" and he gives you this task. The best window of opportunity you have to complete this task is during the <i>Find the bandits' documents</i> task of the storyline as it involves gaining access to Borov's safe. However, once you <i>Free the Dutyer from prison</i> you are no longer welcome at the Bandit's base and will need to fight your way in and out.</p>

<p>When you return to Nimble with the revolver, he says he got tired of waiting and won't pay you. If you keep the gun, you end your working relationship with Nimble and he does not give you any more tasks. Even if you have an item from the "I need a job" tasks, he won't take it. If you give the gun to Nimble and trust him for payment, he gives you the <a herf="#Find-the-experimental-ecolog-suit">Find the experimental ecolog suit</a> task.

<h4 id="Find-the-experimental-ecolog-suit">Find the experimental ecolog suit</h4>
<p>After completing the <a href="LostAlpha.html#Get-wire-for-the-scientist" target="_blank">Get wire for the scientist</a> task, ask Sakharov if he knows anyting about suite designed before the first blowout and he gives you the approximate location in the underground. For this task you will have to fight those bloodsuckers you were able to avoid with the scent blocker used during the <a href="LostAlpha.html#Get-wire-for-the-scientist" target="_blank">Get wire for the scientist</a> task. I recommend grenades and a shotgun with darts and/or slugs. When you get to the room where you retreaved the wire (I'll call it Room 1), arm yourself with a grenade and go into the room where the bloodsuckers are (Room 2), toss the grenade and get back to Room 1. Bloodsuckers will come up to the door, but not into Room 1 and you can use grenades to take out a few before they retreat. Keep baiting them like before, to chase you back to Room 1 where you can kill them safely, eight in all.</p>

<p>Now go back into Room 2, over the rubble, and continue through the passageway into a large room. Go straight for the brain and the next thing you know, you're back in the room where the wire was. Head back to Sakharov, tell him you urgently need his help, and he gives you a <i>PSI-1 Brain wave scanner</i> and <i>Psi-blocker</i>, and the <a href="#Brain-vat">Brain vat</a> task, which sends you back to the brain to take some measurements so he can configure the Psi-blocker helm.</p> 

<h4 id="Brain-vat">Brain vat</h4>
<p>Replace your current artifact scanner with the Brain wave scanner and arm yourself to deal with psi effects (vodka works) and four controllers. If you picked up an RPG along the way, this is the time for it. The idea of the Brain vat task is to take measurement readings for 2:17. The problem is, three controllers. So, what you have to do is to start taking the readings to trigger the controllers, then deal with them so you can finish with the readings. Note that each time you stop with the scanner, even to aim your pistol, the timer starts over. When you get to Room 1 you start to see the effects of a controllers and there may be one waiting in Room 2. Keep an eye on the far-left meter of your inventory. If it gets too low, you die. Take a vodka if the meter gets near half or the psi indicator on your hud turns red.</p>

<p>Take a position in the Brain vat room with your back to the brain and facing the doorway back into Room 2 (south). DO NOT go north of the brain as it means instant death. Keep in mind that there is another doorway on your left that may produce a controller. When you're ready for the controllers, take out the scanner and a pistol to shoot the holograms and keep the psi effects to a minimum. When the first controller shows, hit it with your biggest bang. If you happen to have an RPG, you might get two for one. Watch both doors for the remaining controller(s). When they're all down, take the scanner out again and finish the measurements. You can do this from anywhere inside the metal frame, just don't go north of the brain inside the cage area until Sakhorov adjusts the psi-blocker helm. When the measurement counter winds down, you are again transported to Room 1. Go back to Sakhorov and tell him you're done taking the measurements. He adjust the helm and the task is complete, returning you to the <i>Find the experimental ecolog suit</i> task</p>

<p>The suit is located in behind (north) of the brain vat in the underground. With Sakhorov's adjustments, you can walk in, pick it up, and leave as you please. Nimble can now pay you for the <a href="#Find-the-revolver">revolver</a>, but not for the suit. Give him the suit to complete the task. When you ask him "What's next?", he says he needs to sort things out first and gives you a door key for a bunker under Lake Yantar. The key opens the door behind the Brain Vat, where a staircase takes you to the control room. On the floor next to the control panel is a SSP-10 suit that has the best night vision in the zone.</p>

He goes east of the village to kill fleshes, then northeast of the village to kill some boars. For some reason, the boars eventually run to a tree and line up so you can walk behind them with your knife and finish the job. Talk to Proverb after each cleaning. Completing the task earns you an X-ray PDA Skills Module for your PDA. Open your inventory and double-click it to activate the module.</p>

<!--****Sidorovich****-->
<h2 id="Sidorovich">Sidorovich</h2>
<p>Sidorovich offers the same side jobs as the vanilla SOC and my advice is to obtain the item before taking the task. Otherwise, chances are that time will run out before you can obtain the itme. The follow are tasks exclusive to Lost Alpha:</p>

<h3 id="Work-for-the-Trader">Work for the Trader</h3>
<p>During the Save Fox task when you talk to Fox you get a message from Sidorovich about a special task. When you talk to Sidorovich, ask him, "You said something about a special task?" and at the end of the conversation he gives you the Steal the box from the army outpost task. It doesn't get dark enough to accomplish this task until after 23:00. If you have 10,000ru, you might be able to by some night vision gear from Sidorovich to make this much easier.</p>

<p>Starting on the east side of the road across from the Rookie Village, follow the fence line south until you are directly east of the target. Don't turn your headlamp on or Sidorovich will scold you. This is a good place to save. Now turn west and when you get to the point where Sidorovich radios in to tell you to use the window, use low-crouch to keep sound to a minimum. Watch for the headlamps of the guards to know when to move in. Find the spot where the rain gutter has fallen down and use it as a ramp to get up to the open window on the right. You may need to jump up to the window ledge and move right to get through the window. But you can do this while in the low-crouch position. Once through the window, go to the shelves in the southwest corner of the room and grab the white case. Then, out the way you came in, checking for headlamps as you go. Once you get to the bluff, you can sprint north along the bluff and fence line until you get directly east of the Rookie Village. Turn west and head for Sidorovich's bunker. When you get there, tell him you have the case to complete the task.</p>

<h3 id="Locate-the-contact">Locate the contact</h3>
<p>Ask Sidorovich how many contacts he has to get this task. Freeing Nimble unlocks several optional tasks you can get from him. Nimble is being held by a poltergeist in the Cordon Underground. To get to him, go to the Trade Route Tunnel. Starting from the left (south) side, go in along the ledge to just before the Witches' Jelly anomaly, then turn 45 degrees to the right and walk between the Whirligig anomalies to the other side. Turn to the left and do the same, then right again. Jump up on the ledge and stay against the wall until the tunnel turns to the right, ignoring the zombies for now. If you're lucky, they'll walk into an anomaly and leave you an artifact. When you get to the door on the right, open it and go to the ladder down on the left. Follow the passageway over the stack of crates and corpses. Ahead is a group of sleeping zombies (unarmed) that wake as you approach. You can save your ammo by sprinting and jumping over them. When you come to the closed door, open it and enter the room on the other side, then close the door to keep the zombies out.</p>

<p>In order to free Nimble, you must kill all the poltergeists (approximately eight). You can talk to Nimble through the door at any time, but you risk damage if you step into the passageway while items are floating. When you kill the last poltergeist, the door opens and Nimble is free. Talk to him and then return to Sidorovich to complete the task.</p>

<p><b>NOTE:</b> If a Psy Storm occures during this task, Nimble is able to escape and takes shelter in the trailer where you found the first contact's corpse. Follow him and after the storm, you can talk to Nimble, having the same conversation as you would after killing the last poltergeist. Nimble then returns to the Rookie Village and the task is updated to <i>Report to the trader</i>. You can return to the underground and finish off the poltergeists if you want. Three of them have brains that you can sell.</p> 

<h3 id="Find-the-documents">Find the documents (Agroprom)</h3>
<p>You may already have the first document, <i>Sheet with notes</i> from the <a href="LostAlpha.html#Find-Strelok's-flash-drive" target="_blank">Find Strelok's flash drive</a> task, as the document is in the hideout with the <i>Novel "Deep Darkness"</i>.</p>
 
<p>For this walkthrough, I'm going in with guns blazing since I'm convinced it cannot be completed without gun play. From Ratcatcher's hideout (where you receive the <a href="LostAlpha.html#Find-the-militaries'-documents" target="_blank">Find the militaries' documents</a> task), go south to the road and use the trees on the south side of the road as cover to get as close to the northwest gate. I like this approach as it provides the greatest amount of cover and is furthest from the towers. Plus, there's a document inside the gatehouse. As you proceed through the complex, you may notice the alarm siren stop, then start again. My theory on this is that when you haven't been heard or spotted for a given period of time, the alarm stops. Once one of the military grunts sees or hears you again, it comes back on.</p>

<p>Work your way to, and then inside the gate. Your first objective is the gatehouse, where there's the Invoice on the top shelf inside the cabinet along the west wall. Use the doorway of the gatehouse to shoot from, keeping in mind that the grunts can, and will, shoot through the cabinet on the north side of the doorway. When the way seems clear, sprint east up the road, keeping close to the wall on the left and watch for fire from the guard in the southwest tower. When you come to the first window (near the northwest corner of the building where it meets the broke block wall running north of it), jump up on the ledge and low-crouch through. There's an open doorway in front of you (east) and just south of it is an L-shaped control panel with a desk south of it. On the bottom shelf is the Professor's diary.</p>

<p>Go through the open doorway and to the second window from the right (or any open window - you may even be able to use the door if you've killed all the guards by now) and do the jump-low-croutch thing again to leave the building. The Notebook is in the building in front of you (east), on the far end of the bench just inside the doorway. Now go in the front door of the main building, across the hall, and through the large open door to find the Calculation journal on the desk in the southwest corner of the room. The Science project documentation is near the northeast corner of the same room, on the third-from-the-top shelf of the desk with the chair. The last document is on the third floor in the same room as the <a href="LostAlpha.html#Find-the-militaries'-documents" target="_blank">Find the militaries' documents</a> case, and just east of it on the floor along the north wall. Pick up the <i>Note to the director of Research Institute</i> and take them to Sidorovich. Tell him you're there about the Agroprom documents and he'll offer you the <i>Find the documents (Forest)</i> task. Whether you accept or refuse, the current task is complete.</p>

<h3 id="Find-the-documents-(Forest)">Find the documents (Forest)</h3>
<p>The first document is actually in the Dark Valley Underground and you should be prepared to battle a bloodsucker. There is a pyrogeist patroling the outside of the cave, and may enter the cave, but is easily avoided. Go to the area east of the Bandit base marked <i>Old entrance</i> and locate the cave opening north of the green trailer. Inside, go up the steps (goodies along the left wall), turn right to go down the steps and around to the right where the three dead bandits are. Go to the gap in the floor and drop down onto the pipe (don't use the ladder). Low-crouch and move southeast to drop down on the east side of the pipe. Go to the end of the passageway, turn left and locate the <i>Research Journal</i> in the northeast corner next to the lamp. To leave, go back to the ladder, low-crouch to jump up onto the pipe just south of the ladder, then use the ladder to get out of the hole. Now low-crouch along the west wall to get past the pipes.</p>

<p><b>NOTE:</b> One of the dead bandits has a Bandit jacket in his backpack. If you take it, a bloodsucker spawns just around the corner on the right.</p>

<p>All but one of the remaining Forest documents are scattered among the buildings of the Bandit Mine. As you approach the complex you get a call for help. There's a wounded stalker along the road near the site, and if you stop to talk to him, he asks you to help his friend (whom I've yet to find). Drive into the complex and stop at the guard shack for a can of petrol. Then on into the complex, turning left (south) after the tanker truck and stop the car to go into the building through the open doorway. Turn left inside the doorway and go up the stairs, then make a U-turn left and to north to that end of the building to find two more cans of petrol. Now to the building west of the one you're in. Up the stairs and to the overturned desk to find the <i>Letter</i>. Through the doorway south of the desk, left doorway and make a U-turn left to find the <i>Report</i> between the crate and east wall in the northeast corner of the room. Again, going to the building west of your position, up the ladder to the desk to find the <i>Contrack</i> on the shelf below the desk top (you probably need to crouch to see it).</p>

<p>The last document is actually in the mine, but it's not as easy as the previous documents. Before you go in, arm yourself for battle with a controller. Go into the mine and sprint to where the shaft branches. Take the far-right opening into the storage area and grab the <i>Finacial papers</i> on the east end of the shelves. Now exit the room and take the last shaft on the right, then left through the hole in the wall and down to the door on the right. Break open the boxes and grab the Compass artifact. Now sprint out the way you came in. If you're lucky, you won't need to fight the controller. If you want to loot the mine, then you must defeat the controller first. Sidorovich's instructions are to take the documents to Petrenko. Tell him, "I've wanted to talk about the docs." and he gives you 4500 RSz and a Battery artifact to complete the task.</p>
